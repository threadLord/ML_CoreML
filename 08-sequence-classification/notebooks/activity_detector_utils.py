  sframe_from_folder: Given the path to a folder, this function reads all the
                      .csv files in that folder and creates a Turi Create SFrame
                      containing their data. The columns are renamed to match the
                      features they contain, and a new "userId" column is added.
                      The csv files in folder should be created with the
                      GestureDataRecorder app. If any changes are made to the 
                      features recorded by that app (different features or different order)
                      then this code needs to be changed to match.

  append_uid_column: Helper function that takes a Turi Create SFrame and a path

                     named "userId" to the SFrame and populates every row of it
                     with the same value â€“ the prefix of the filename up to the 
                     first dash '-'. For example, if from_path is "/path/to/some-file.csv",
                     the userId column will be filled with the value "some".
