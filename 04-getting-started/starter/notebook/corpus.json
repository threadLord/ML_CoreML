Where is he?--\nEven these words went echoing dismally\nThrough the wide forest--a most fearful tone,\nLike one repenting in his latest moan;\nAnd while it died away a shade pass'd by,\nAs of a thunder cloud. When arrows fly\nThrough the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth\nTheir timid necks and tremble; so these both\nLeant to each other trembling, and sat so\nWaiting for some destruction--when lo,\nFoot-feather'd Mercury appear'd sublime\nBeyond the tall tree tops; and in less time\nThan shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt\nTowards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt\nOne moment from his home: only the sward\nHe with his wand light touch'd, and heavenward\nSwifter than sight was gone--even before\nThe teeming earth a sudden witness bore\nOf his swift magic. Diving swans appear\nAbove the crystal circlings white and clear;\nAnd catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,\nHow they can dive in sight and unseen rise--\nSo from the turf outsprang two steeds jet-black,\nEach with large dark blue wings upon his back.\nThe youth of Caria plac'd the lovely dame\nOn one, and felt himself in spleen to tame\nThe other's fierceness. Through the air they flew,\nHigh as the eagles. Like two drops of dew\nExhal'd to Phoebus' lips, away they are gone,\nFar from the earth away--unseen, alone,\nAmong cool clouds and winds, but that the free,\nThe buoyant life of song can floating be\nAbove their heads, and follow them untir'd.--\nMuse of my native land, am I inspir'd?\nThis is the giddy air, and I must spread\nWide pinions to keep here; nor do I dread\nOr height, or depth, or width, or any chance\nPrecipitous: I have beneath my glance\nThose towering horses and their mournful freight.\nCould I thus sail, and see, and thus await\nFearless for power of thought, without thine aid?--\nThere is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade\nFrom some approaching wonder, and behold\nThose winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold\nSnuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,\nDying to embers from their native fire!\n\n  There curl'd a purple mist around them; soon,\nIt seem'd as when around the pale new moon\nSad Zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow:\n'Twas Sleep slow journeying with head on pillow.\nFor the first time, since he came nigh dead born\nFrom the old womb of night, his cave forlorn\nHad he left more forlorn; for the first time,\nHe felt aloof the day and morning's prime--\nBecause into his depth Cimmerian\nThere came a dream, shewing how a young man,\nEre a lean bat could plump its wintery skin,\nWould at high Jove's empyreal footstool win\nAn immortality, and how espouse\nJove's daughter, and be reckon'd of his house.\nNow was he slumbering towards heaven's gate,\nThat he might at the threshold one hour wait\nTo hear the marriage melodies, and then\nSink downward to his dusky cave again.\nHis litter of smooth semilucent mist,\nDiversely ting'd with rose and amethyst,\nPuzzled those eyes that for the centre sought;\nAnd scarcely for one moment could be caught\nHis sluggish form reposing motionless.\nThose two on winged steeds, with all the stress\nOf vision search'd for him, as one would look\nAthwart the sallows of a river nook\nTo catch a glance at silver throated eels,--\nOr from old Skiddaw's top, when fog conceals\nHis rugged forehead in a mantle pale,\nWith an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale\nDescry a favourite hamlet faint and far.\n\n  These raven horses, though they foster'd are\nOf earth's splenetic fire, dully drop\nTheir full-veined ears, nostrils blood wide, and stop;\nUpon the spiritless mist have they outspread\nTheir ample feathers, are in slumber dead,--\nAnd on those pinions, level in mid air,\nEndymion sleepeth and the lady fair.\nSlowly they sail, slowly as icy isle\nUpon a calm sea drifting: and meanwhile\nThe mournful wanderer dreams. Behold! he walks\nOn heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks\nTo divine powers: from his hand full fain\nJuno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain:\nHe tries the nerve of Phoebus' golden bow,\nAnd asketh where the golden apples grow:\nUpon his arm he braces Pallas' shield,\nAnd strives in vain to unsettle and wield\nA Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings\nA full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings\nAnd tantalizes long; at last he drinks,\nAnd lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,\nTouching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.\nHe blows a bugle,--an ethereal band\nAre visible above: the Seasons four,--\nGreen-kyrtled Spring, flush Summer, golden store\nIn Autumn's sickle, Winter frosty hoar,\nJoin dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,\nIn swells unmitigated, still doth last\nTo sway their floating morris. \"Whose is this?\nWhose bugle?\" he inquires: they smile--\"O Dis!\nWhy is this mortal here? Dost thou not know\nIts mistress' lips? Not thou?--'Tis Dian's: lo!\nShe rises crescented!\" He looks, 'tis she,\nHis very goddess: good-bye earth, and sea,\nAnd air, and pains, and care, and suffering;\nGood-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring\nTowards her, and awakes--and, strange, o'erhead,\nOf those same fragrant exhalations bred,\nBeheld awake his very dream: the gods\nStood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;\nAnd Phoebe bends towards him crescented.\nO state perplexing! On the pinion bed,\nToo well awake, he feels the panting side\nOf his delicious lady. He who died\nFor soaring too audacious in the sun,\nWhere that same treacherous wax began to run,\nFelt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.\nHis heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,\nTo that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way--\nAh, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!\nSo fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,\nHe could not help but kiss her: then he grew\nAwhile forgetful of all beauty save\nYoung Phoebe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave\nForgiveness: yet he turn'd once more to look\nAt the sweet sleeper,--all his soul was shook,--\nShe press'd his hand in slumber; so once more\nHe could not help but kiss her and adore.\nAt this the shadow wept, melting away.\nThe Latmian started up: \"Bright goddess, stay!\nSearch my most hidden breast! By truth's own tongue,\nI have no dædale heart: why is it wrung\nTo desperation? Is there nought for me,\nUpon the bourne of bliss, but misery?\"\n\n  These words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:\nHer dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses\nWith 'haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.\n\"Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe\nThis murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st\nPillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st\nWhat horrors may discomfort thee and me.\nAh, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!--\nYet did she merely weep--her gentle soul\nHath no revenge in it: as it is whole\nIn tenderness, would I were whole in love!\nCan I prize thee, fair maid, all price above,\nEven when I feel as true as innocence?\nI do, I do.--What is this soul then? Whence\nCame it? It does not seem my own, and I\nHave no self-passion or identity.\nSome fearful end must be: where, where is it?\nBy Nemesis, I see my spirit flit\nAlone about the dark--Forgive me, sweet:\nShall we away?\" He rous'd the steeds: they beat\nTheir wings chivalrous into the clear air,\nLeaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.\n\n  The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,\nAnd Vesper, risen star, began to throe\nIn the dusk heavens silvery, when they\nThus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.\nNor did speed hinder converse soft and strange--\nEternal oaths and vows they interchange,\nIn such wise, in such temper, so aloof\nUp in the winds, beneath a starry roof,\nSo witless of their doom, that verily\n'Tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;\nWhether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd--\nMost like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy'd.\n\n  Full facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,\nThe moon put forth a little diamond peak,\nNo bigger than an unobserved star,\nOr tiny point of fairy scymetar;\nBright signal that she only stoop'd to tie\nHer silver sandals, ere deliciously\nShe bow'd into the heavens her timid head.\nSlowly she rose, as though she would have fled,\nWhile to his lady meek the Carian turn'd,\nTo mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd\nThis beauty in its birth--Despair! despair!\nHe saw her body fading gaunt and spare\nIn the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist;\nIt melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,\nAnd, horror! kiss'd his own--he was alone.\nHer steed a little higher soar'd, and then\nDropt hawkwise to the earth.        There lies a den,\nBeyond the seeming confines of the space\nMade for the soul to wander in and trace\nIts own existence, of remotest glooms.\nDark regions are around it, where the tombs\nOf buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce\nOne hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce\nOf new-born woe it feels more inly smart:\nAnd in these regions many a venom'd dart\nAt random flies; they are the proper home\nOf every ill: the man is yet to come\nWho hath not journeyed in this native hell.\nBut few have ever felt how calm and well\nSleep may be had in that deep den of all.\nThere anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:\nWoe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,\nYet all is still within and desolate.\nBeset with painful gusts, within ye hear\nNo sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier\nThe death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none\nWho strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.\nJust when the sufferer begins to burn,\nThen it is free to him; and from an urn,\nStill fed by melting ice, he takes a draught--\nYoung Semele such richness never quaft\nIn her maternal longing. Happy gloom!\nDark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom\nOf health by due; where silence dreariest\nIs most articulate; where hopes infest;\nWhere those eyes are the brightest far that keep\nTheir lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.\nO happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!\nPregnant with such a den to save the whole\nIn thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!\nFor, never since thy griefs and woes began,\nHast thou felt so content: a grievous feud\nHath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.\nAye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne\nWith dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn\nBecause he knew not whither he was going.\nSo happy was he, not the aerial blowing\nOf trumpets at clear parley from the east\nCould rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.\nThey stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm\nHe flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm\nCould lift Endymion's head, or he had view'd\nA skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,--\nAnd silvery was its passing: voices sweet\nWarbling the while as if to lull and greet\nThe wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,\nWhile past the vision went in bright array.\n\n  \"Who, who from Dian's feast would be away?\nFor all the golden bowers of the day\nAre empty left? Who, who away would be\nFrom Cynthia's wedding and festivity?\nNot Hesperus: lo! upon his silver wings\nHe leans away for highest heaven and sings,\nSnapping his lucid fingers merrily!--\nAh, Zephyrus! art here, and Flora too!\nYe tender bibbers of the rain and dew,\nYoung playmates of the rose and daffodil,\nBe careful, ere ye enter in, to fill\n        Your baskets high\nWith fennel green, and balm, and golden pines,\nSavory, latter-mint, and columbines,\nCool parsley, basil sweet, and sunny thyme;\nYea, every flower and leaf of every clime,\nAll gather'd in the dewy morning: hie\n        Away! fly, fly!--\nCrystalline brother of the belt of heaven,\nAquarius! to whom king Jove has given\nTwo liquid pulse streams 'stead of feather'd wings,\nTwo fan-like fountains,--thine illuminings\n        For Dian play:\nDissolve the frozen purity of air;\nLet thy white shoulders silvery and bare\nShew cold through watery pinions; make more bright\nThe Star-Queen's crescent on her marriage night:\n        Haste, haste away!--\nCastor has tamed the planet Lion, see!\nAnd of the Bear has Pollux mastery:\nA third is in the race! who is the third,\nSpeeding away swift as the eagle bird?\n        The ramping Centaur!\nThe Lion's mane's on end: the Bear how fierce!\nThe Centaur's arrow ready seems to pierce\nSome enemy: far forth his bow is bent\nInto the blue of heaven.

Where?--who? who\nLeft thee so quiet on this bed of dew?\nBehold upon this happy earth we are;\nLet us ay love each other; let us fare\nOn forest-fruits, and never, never go\nAmong the abodes of mortals here below,\nOr be by phantoms duped. O destiny!\nInto a labyrinth now my soul would fly,\nBut with thy beauty will I deaden it.\nWhere didst thou melt too? By thee will I sit\nFor ever: let our fate stop here--a kid\nI on this spot will offer: Pan will bid\nUs live in peace, in love and peace among\nHis forest wildernesses. I have clung\nTo nothing, lov'd a nothing, nothing seen\nOr felt but a great dream! O I have been\nPresumptuous against love, against the sky,\nAgainst all elements, against the tie\nOf mortals each to each, against the blooms\nOf flowers, rush of rivers, and the tombs\nOf heroes gone! Against his proper glory\nHas my own soul conspired: so my story\nWill I to children utter, and repent.\nThere never liv'd a mortal man, who bent\nHis appetite beyond his natural sphere,\nBut starv'd and died. My sweetest Indian, here,\nHere will I kneel, for thou redeemed hast\nMy life from too thin breathing: gone and past\nAre cloudy phantasms. Caverns lone, farewel!\nAnd air of visions, and the monstrous swell\nOf visionary seas! No, never more\nShall airy voices cheat me to the shore\nOf tangled wonder, breathless and aghast.\nAdieu, my daintiest Dream! although so vast\nMy love is still for thee. The hour may come\nWhen we shall meet in pure elysium.\nOn earth I may not love thee; and therefore\nDoves will I offer up, and sweetest store\nAll through the teeming year: so thou wilt shine\nOn me, and on this damsel fair of mine,\nAnd bless our simple lives. My Indian bliss!\nMy river-lily bud! one human kiss!\nOne sigh of real breath--one gentle squeeze,\nWarm as a dove's nest among summer trees,\nAnd warm with dew at ooze from living blood!\nWhither didst melt? Ah, what of that!--all good\nWe'll talk about--no more of dreaming.--Now,\nWhere shall our dwelling be? Under the brow\nOf some steep mossy hill, where ivy dun\nWould hide us up, although spring leaves were none;\nAnd where dark yew trees, as we rustle through,\nWill drop their scarlet berry cups of dew?\nO thou wouldst joy to live in such a place;\nDusk for our loves, yet light enough to grace\nThose gentle limbs on mossy bed reclin'd:\nFor by one step the blue sky shouldst thou find,\nAnd by another, in deep dell below,\nSee, through the trees, a little river go\nAll in its mid-day gold and glimmering.\nHoney from out the gnarled hive I'll bring,\nAnd apples, wan with sweetness, gather thee,--\nCresses that grow where no man may them see,\nAnd sorrel untorn by the dew-claw'd stag:\nPipes will I fashion of the syrinx flag,\nThat thou mayst always know whither I roam,\nWhen it shall please thee in our quiet home\nTo listen and think of love. Still let me speak;\nStill let me dive into the joy I seek,--\nFor yet the past doth prison me. The rill,\nThou haply mayst delight in, will I fill\nWith fairy fishes from the mountain tarn,\nAnd thou shalt feed them from the squirrel's barn.\nIts bottom will I strew with amber shells,\nAnd pebbles blue from deep enchanted wells.\nIts sides I'll plant with dew-sweet eglantine,\nAnd honeysuckles full of clear bee-wine.\nI will entice this crystal rill to trace\nLove's silver name upon the meadow's face.\nI'll kneel to Vesta, for a flame of fire;\nAnd to god Phoebus, for a golden lyre;\nTo Empress Dian, for a hunting spear;\nTo Vesper, for a taper silver-clear,\nThat I may see thy beauty through the night;\nTo Flora, and a nightingale shall light\nTame on thy finger; to the River-gods,\nAnd they shall bring thee taper fishing-rods\nOf gold, and lines of Naiads' long bright tress.\nHeaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!\nThy mossy footstool shall the altar be\n'Fore which I'll bend, bending, dear love, to thee:\nThose lips shall be my Delphos, and shall speak\nLaws to my footsteps, colour to my cheek,\nTrembling or stedfastness to this same voice,\nAnd of three sweetest pleasurings the choice:\nAnd that affectionate light, those diamond things,\nThose eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,\nShall be my grief, or twinkle me to pleasure.\nSay, is not bliss within our perfect seisure?\nO that I could not doubt?\"\n\n                              The mountaineer\nThus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear\nHis briar'd path to some tranquillity.\nIt gave bright gladness to his lady's eye,\nAnd yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;\nAnswering thus, just as the golden morrow\nBeam'd upward from the vallies of the east:\n\"O that the flutter of this heart had ceas'd,\nOr the sweet name of love had pass'd away.\nYoung feather'd tyrant! by a swift decay\nWilt thou devote this body to the earth:\nAnd I do think that at my very birth\nI lisp'd thy blooming titles inwardly;\nFor at the first, first dawn and thought of thee,\nWith uplift hands I blest the stars of heaven.\nArt thou not cruel? Ever have I striven\nTo think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!\nWhen yet a child, I heard that kisses drew\nFavour from thee, and so I kisses gave\nTo the void air, bidding them find out love:\nBut when I came to feel how far above\nAll fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,\nAll earthly pleasure, all imagin'd good,\nWas the warm tremble of a devout kiss,--\nEven then, that moment, at the thought of this,\nFainting I fell into a bed of flowers,\nAnd languish'd there three days. Ye milder powers,\nAm I not cruelly wrong'd? Believe, believe\nMe, dear Endymion, were I to weave\nWith my own fancies garlands of sweet life,\nThou shouldst be one of all. Ah, bitter strife!\nI may not be thy love: I am forbidden--\nIndeed I am--thwarted, affrighted, chidden,\nBy things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.\nTwice hast thou ask'd whither I went: henceforth\nAsk me no more! I may not utter it,\nNor may I be thy love. We might commit\nOurselves at once to vengeance; we might die;\nWe might embrace and die: voluptuous thought!\nEnlarge not to my hunger, or I'm caught\nIn trammels of perverse deliciousness.\nNo, no, that shall not be: thee will I bless,\nAnd bid a long adieu.\"\n\n                          The Carian\nNo word return'd: both lovelorn, silent, wan,\nInto the vallies green together went.\nFar wandering, they were perforce content\nTo sit beneath a fair lone beechen tree;\nNor at each other gaz'd, but heavily\nPor'd on its hazle cirque of shedded leaves.\n\n  Endymion! unhappy! it nigh grieves\nMe to behold thee thus in last extreme:\nEnsky'd ere this, but truly that I deem\nTruth the best music in a first-born song.\nThy lute-voic'd brother will I sing ere long,\nAnd thou shalt aid--hast thou not aided me?\nYes, moonlight Emperor! felicity\nHas been thy meed for many thousand years;\nYet often have I, on the brink of tears,\nMourn'd as if yet thou wert a forester,--\nForgetting the old tale.\n\n                            He did not stir\nHis eyes from the dead leaves, or one small pulse\nOf joy he might have felt. The spirit culls\nUnfaded amaranth, when wild it strays\nThrough the old garden-ground of boyish days.\nA little onward ran the very stream\nBy which he took his first soft poppy dream;\nAnd on the very bark 'gainst which he leant\nA crescent he had carv'd, and round it spent\nHis skill in little stars. The teeming tree\nHad swollen and green'd the pious charactery,\nBut not ta'en out. Why, there was not a slope\nUp which he had not fear'd the antelope;\nAnd not a tree, beneath whose rooty shade\nHe had not with his tamed leopards play'd.\nNor could an arrow light, or javelin,\nFly in the air where his had never been--\nAnd yet he knew it not.\n\n                          O treachery!\nWhy does his lady smile, pleasing her eye\nWith all his sorrowing? He sees her not.\nBut who so stares on him? His sister sure!\nPeona of the woods!--Can she endure--\nImpossible--how dearly they embrace!\nHis lady smiles; delight is in her face;\nIt is no treachery.\n\n                      \"Dear brother mine!\nEndymion, weep not so! Why shouldst thou pine\nWhen all great Latmos so exalt wilt be?\nThank the great gods, and look not bitterly;\nAnd speak not one pale word, and sigh no more.\nSure I will not believe thou hast such store\nOf grief, to last thee to my kiss again.\nThou surely canst not bear a mind in pain,\nCome hand in hand with one so beautiful.\nBe happy both of you! for I will pull\nThe flowers of autumn for your coronals.\nPan's holy priest for young Endymion calls;\nAnd when he is restor'd, thou, fairest dame,\nShalt be our queen. Now, is it not a shame\nTo see ye thus,--not very, very sad?\nPerhaps ye are too happy to be glad:\nO feel as if it were a common day;\nFree-voic'd as one who never was away.\nNo tongue shall ask, whence come ye? but ye shall\nBe gods of your own rest imperial.\nNot even I, for one whole month, will pry\nInto the hours that have pass'd us by,\nSince in my arbour I did sing to thee.\nO Hermes! on this very night will be\nA hymning up to Cynthia, queen of light;\nFor the soothsayers old saw yesternight\nGood visions in the air,--whence will befal,\nAs say these sages, health perpetual\nTo shepherds and their flocks; and furthermore,\nIn Dian's face they read the gentle lore:\nTherefore for her these vesper-carols are.\nOur friends will all be there from nigh and far.\nMany upon thy death have ditties made;\nAnd many, even now, their foreheads shade\nWith cypress, on a day of sacrifice.\nNew singing for our maids shalt thou devise,\nAnd pluck the sorrow from our huntsmen's brows.\nTell me, my lady-queen, how to espouse\nThis wayward brother to his rightful joys!\nHis eyes are on thee bent, as thou didst poise\nHis fate most goddess-like. Help me, I pray,\nTo lure--Endymion, dear brother, say\nWhat ails thee?\" He could bear no more, and so\nBent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,\nAnd twang'd it inwardly, and calmly said:\n\"I would have thee my only friend, sweet maid!\nMy only visitor! not ignorant though,\nThat those deceptions which for pleasure go\n'Mong men, are pleasures real as real may be:\nBut there are higher ones I may not see,\nIf impiously an earthly realm I take.\nSince I saw thee, I have been wide awake\nNight after night, and day by day, until\nOf the empyrean I have drunk my fill.\nLet it content thee, Sister, seeing me\nMore happy than betides mortality.\nA hermit young, I'll live in mossy cave,\nWhere thou alone shalt come to me, and lave\nThy spirit in the wonders I shall tell.\nThrough me the shepherd realm shall prosper well;\nFor to thy tongue will I all health confide.\nAnd, for my sake, let this young maid abide\nWith thee as a dear sister. Thou alone,\nPeona, mayst return to me. I own\nThis may sound strangely: but when, dearest girl,\nThou seest it for my happiness, no pearl\nWill trespass down those cheeks. Companion fair!\nWilt be content to dwell with her, to share\nThis sister's love with me?\" Like one resign'd\nAnd bent by circumstance, and thereby blind\nIn self-commitment, thus that meek unknown:\n\"Aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,\nOf jubilee to Dian:--truth I heard!\nWell then, I see there is no little bird,\nTender soever, but is Jove's own care.\nLong have I sought for rest, and, unaware,\nBehold I find it! so exalted too!\nSo after my own heart! I knew, I knew\nThere was a place untenanted in it:\nIn that same void white Chastity shall sit,\nAnd monitor me nightly to lone slumber.\nWith sanest lips I vow me to the number\nOf Dian's sisterhood; and, kind lady,\nWith thy good help, this very night shall see\nMy future days to her fane consecrate.\"\n\n  As feels a dreamer what doth most create\nHis own particular fright, so these three felt:\nOr like one who, in after ages, knelt\nTo Lucifer or Baal, when he'd pine\nAfter a little sleep: or when in mine\nFar under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends\nWho know him not. Each diligently bends\nTowards common thoughts and things for very fear;\nStriving their ghastly malady to cheer,\nBy thinking it a thing of yes and no,\nThat housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow\nWas struck, and all were dreamers. At the last\nEndymion said: \"Are not our fates all cast?\nWhy stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!\nAdieu!\" Whereat those maidens, with wild stare,\nWalk'd dizzily away. Pained and hot\nHis eyes went after them, until they got\nNear to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,\nIn one swift moment, would what then he saw\nEngulph for ever. \"Stay!\" he cried, \"ah, stay!\nTurn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say.\nSweet Indian, I would see thee once again.\nIt is a thing I dote on: so I'd fain,\nPeona, ye should hand in hand repair\nInto those holy groves, that silent are\nBehind great Dian's temple. I'll be yon,\nAt vesper's earliest twinkle--they are gone--\nBut once, once, once again--\" At this he press'd\nHis hands against his face, and then did rest\nHis head upon a mossy hillock green,\nAnd so remain'd as he a corpse had been\nAll the long day; save when he scantly lifted\nHis eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted\nWith the slow move of time,--sluggish and weary\nUntil the poplar tops, in journey dreary,\nHad reach'd the river's brim. Then up he rose,\nAnd, slowly as that very river flows,\nWalk'd towards the temple grove with this lament:\n\"Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent\nCareful and soft, that not a leaf may fall\nBefore the serene father of them all\nBows down his summer head below the west.\nNow am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,\nBut at the setting I must bid adieu\nTo her for the last time. Night will strew\nOn the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,\nAnd with them shall I die; nor much it grieves\nTo die, when summer dies on the cold sward.\nWhy, I have been a butterfly, a lord\nOf flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,\nGroves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;\nMy kingdom's at its death, and just it is\nThat I should die with it: so in all this\nWe miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,\nWhat is there to plain of? By Titan's foe\nI am but rightly serv'd.\" So saying, he\nTripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;\nLaughing at the clear stream and setting sun,\nAs though they jests had been: nor had he done\nHis laugh at nature's holy countenance,\nUntil that grove appear'd, as if perchance,\nAnd then his tongue with sober seemlihed\nGave utterance as he entered: \"Ha!\" I said,\n\"King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,\nAnd by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,\nThis dusk religion, pomp of solitude,\nAnd the Promethean clay by thief endued,\nBy old Saturnus' forelock, by his head\nShook with eternal palsy, I did wed\nMyself to things of light from infancy;\nAnd thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,\nIs sure enough to make a mortal man\nGrow impious.\" So he inwardly began\nOn things for which no wording can be found;\nDeeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd\nBeyond the reach of music: for the choir\nOf Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar\nNor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull\nThe vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,\nThrough the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.\nHe saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,\nWan as primroses gather'd at midnight\nBy chilly finger'd spring. \"Unhappy wight!\nEndymion!\" said Peona, \"we are here!\nWhat wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?\"\nThen he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand\nPress'd, saying:\" Sister, I would have command,\nIf it were heaven's will, on our sad fate.\"\nAt which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate\nAnd said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,\nTo Endymion's amaze: \"By Cupid's dove,\nAnd so thou shalt! and by the lily truth\nOf my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!\"\nAnd as she spake, into her face there came\nLight, as reflected from a silver flame:\nHer long black hair swell'd ampler, in display\nFull golden; in her eyes a brighter day\nDawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld\nPhoebe, his passion! joyous she upheld\nHer lucid bow, continuing thus; \"Drear, drear\nHas our delaying been; but foolish fear\nWithheld me first; and then decrees of fate;\nAnd then 'twas fit that from this mortal state\nThou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change\nBe spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range\nThese forests, and to thee they safe shall be\nAs was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee\nTo meet us many a time.\" Next Cynthia bright\nPeona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night:\nHer brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown\nBefore his goddess, in a blissful swoon.\nShe gave her fair hands to him, and behold,\nBefore three swiftest kisses he had told,\nThey vanish'd far away!--Peona went\nHome through the gloomy wood in wonderment."},{"title":"In Drear-Nighted December","author":"John Keats","text":"In drear-nighted December,\nToo happy, happy tree,\nThy branches ne'er remember\nTheir green felicity:\nThe north cannot undo them\nWith a sleety whistle through them;\nNor frozen thawings glue them\n From budding at the prime.\n\nIn drear-nighted December,\nToo happy, happy brook,\nThy bubblings ne'er remember\nApollo's summer look;\nBut with a sweet forgetting,\nThey stay their crystal fretting,\nNever, never petting\nAbout the frozen time.\n\nAh!

Such the sun, the moon,\nTrees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\n'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\nAll lovely tales that we have heard or read:\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\nPouring unto us from the heaven's brink.\n\n  Nor do we merely feel these essences\nFor one short hour; no, even as the trees\nThat whisper round a temple become soon\nDear as the temple's self, so does the moon,\nThe passion poesy, glories infinite,\nHaunt us till they become a cheering light\nUnto our souls, and bound to us so fast,\nThat, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,\nThey alway must be with us, or we die.\n\n  Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I\nWill trace the story of Endymion.\nThe very music of the name has gone\nInto my being, and each pleasant scene\nIs growing fresh before me as the green\nOf our own vallies: so I will begin\nNow while I cannot hear the city's din;\nNow while the early budders are just new,\nAnd run in mazes of the youngest hue\nAbout old forests; while the willow trails\nIts delicate amber; and the dairy pails\nBring home increase of milk. And, as the year\nGrows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer\nMy little boat, for many quiet hours,\nWith streams that deepen freshly into bowers.\nMany and many a verse I hope to write,\nBefore the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,\nHide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees\nHum about globes of clover and sweet peas,\nI must be near the middle of my story.\nO may no wintry season, bare and hoary,\nSee it half finished: but let Autumn bold,\nWith universal tinge of sober gold,\nBe all about me when I make an end.\nAnd now at once, adventuresome, I send\nMy herald thought into a wilderness:\nThere let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress\nMy uncertain path with green, that I may speed\nEasily onward, thorough flowers and weed.\n\n  Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread\nA mighty forest; for the moist earth fed\nSo plenteously all weed-hidden roots\nInto o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.\nAnd it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,\nWhere no man went; and if from shepherd's keep\nA lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,\nNever again saw he the happy pens\nWhither his brethren, bleating with content,\nOver the hills at every nightfall went.\nAmong the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,\nThat not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever\nFrom the white flock, but pass'd unworried\nBy angry wolf, or pard with prying head,\nUntil it came to some unfooted plains\nWhere fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains\nWho thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,\nWinding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,\nAnd ivy banks; all leading pleasantly\nTo a wide lawn, whence one could only see\nStems thronging all around between the swell\nOf turf and slanting branches: who could tell\nThe freshness of the space of heaven above,\nEdg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove\nWould often beat its wings, and often too\nA little cloud would move across the blue.\n\n  Full in the middle of this pleasantness\nThere stood a marble altar, with a tress\nOf flowers budded newly; and the dew\nHad taken fairy phantasies to strew\nDaisies upon the sacred sward last eve,\nAnd so the dawned light in pomp receive.\nFor 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire\nMade every eastern cloud a silvery pyre\nOf brightness so unsullied, that therein\nA melancholy spirit well might win\nOblivion, and melt out his essence fine\nInto the winds: rain-scented eglantine\nGave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;\nThe lark was lost in him; cold springs had run\nTo warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;\nMan's voice was on the mountains; and the mass\nOf nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,\nTo feel this sun-rise and its glories old.\n\n  Now while the silent workings of the dawn\nWere busiest, into that self-same lawn\nAll suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped\nA troop of little children garlanded;\nWho gathering round the altar, seemed to pry\nEarnestly round as wishing to espy\nSome folk of holiday: nor had they waited\nFor many moments, ere their ears were sated\nWith a faint breath of music, which ev'n then\nFill'd out its voice, and died away again.\nWithin a little space again it gave\nIts airy swellings, with a gentle wave,\nTo light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking\nThrough copse-clad vallies,--ere their death, oer-taking\nThe surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.\n\n  And now, as deep into the wood as we\nMight mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light\nFair faces and a rush of garments white,\nPlainer and plainer shewing, till at last\nInto the widest alley they all past,\nMaking directly for the woodland altar.\nO kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter\nIn telling of this goodly company,\nOf their old piety, and of their glee:\nBut let a portion of ethereal dew\nFall on my head, and presently unmew\nMy soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,\nTo stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.\n\n  Leading the way, young damsels danced along,\nBearing the burden of a shepherd song;\nEach having a white wicker over brimm'd\nWith April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,\nA crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks\nAs may be read of in Arcadian books;\nSuch as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,\nWhen the great deity, for earth too ripe,\nLet his divinity o'er-flowing die\nIn music, through the vales of Thessaly:\nSome idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,\nAnd some kept up a shrilly mellow sound\nWith ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,\nNow coming from beneath the forest trees,\nA venerable priest full soberly,\nBegirt with ministring looks: alway his eye\nStedfast upon the matted turf he kept,\nAnd after him his sacred vestments swept.\nFrom his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,\nOf mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;\nAnd in his left he held a basket full\nOf all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:\nWild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still\nThan Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.\nHis aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,\nSeem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth\nOf winter hoar. Then came another crowd\nOf shepherds, lifting in due time aloud\nTheir share of the ditty. After them appear'd,\nUp-followed by a multitude that rear'd\nTheir voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,\nEasily rolling so as scarce to mar\nThe freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:\nWho stood therein did seem of great renown\nAmong the throng. His youth was fully blown,\nShewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;\nAnd, for those simple times, his garments were\nA chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,\nWas hung a silver bugle, and between\nHis nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.\nA smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,\nTo common lookers on, like one who dream'd\nOf idleness in groves Elysian:\nBut there were some who feelingly could scan\nA lurking trouble in his nether lip,\nAnd see that oftentimes the reins would slip\nThrough his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,\nAnd think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,\nOf logs piled solemnly.--Ah, well-a-day,\nWhy should our young Endymion pine away!\n\n  Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,\nStood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd\nTo sudden veneration: women meek\nBeckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek\nOf virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.\nEndymion too, without a forest peer,\nStood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,\nAmong his brothers of the mountain chase.\nIn midst of all, the venerable priest\nEyed them with joy from greatest to the least,\nAnd, after lifting up his aged hands,\nThus spake he: \"Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!\nWhose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:\nWhether descended from beneath the rocks\nThat overtop your mountains; whether come\nFrom vallies where the pipe is never dumb;\nOr from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs\nBlue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze\nBuds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge\nNibble their fill at ocean's very marge,\nWhose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn\nBy the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:\nMothers and wives! who day by day prepare\nThe scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;\nAnd all ye gentle girls who foster up\nUdderless lambs, and in a little cup\nWill put choice honey for a favoured youth:\nYea, every one attend! for in good truth\nOur vows are wanting to our great god Pan.\nAre not our lowing heifers sleeker than\nNight-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains\nSpeckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains\nGreen'd over April's lap? No howling sad\nSickens our fearful ewes; and we have had\nGreat bounty from Endymion our lord.\nThe earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd\nHis early song against yon breezy sky,\nThat spreads so clear o'er our solemnity.\"\n\n  Thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire\nOf teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;\nAnon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod\nWith wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.\nNow while the earth was drinking it, and while\nBay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,\nAnd gummy frankincense was sparkling bright\n'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light\nSpread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:\n\n  \"O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang\nFrom jagged trunks, and overshadoweth\nEternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death\nOf unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;\nWho lov'st to see the hamadryads dress\nTheir ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;\nAnd through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken\nThe dreary melody of bedded reeds--\nIn desolate places, where dank moisture breeds\nThe pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;\nBethinking thee, how melancholy loth\nThou wast to lose fair Syrinx--do thou now,\nBy thy love's milky brow!\nBy all the trembling mazes that she ran,\nHear us, great Pan!\n\n  \"O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles\nPassion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,\nWhat time thou wanderest at eventide\nThrough sunny meadows, that outskirt the side\nOf thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom\nBroad leaved fig trees even now foredoom\nTheir ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees\nTheir golden honeycombs; our village leas\nTheir fairest-blossom'd beans and poppied corn;\nThe chuckling linnet its five young unborn,\nTo sing for thee; low creeping strawberries\nTheir summer coolness; pent up butterflies\nTheir freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year\nAll its completions--be quickly near,\nBy every wind that nods the mountain pine,\nO forester divine!\n\n  \"Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies\nFor willing service; whether to surprise\nThe squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;\nOr upward ragged precipices flit\nTo save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;\nOr by mysterious enticement draw\nBewildered shepherds to their path again;\nOr to tread breathless round the frothy main,\nAnd gather up all fancifullest shells\nFor thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,\nAnd, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;\nOr to delight thee with fantastic leaping,\nThe while they pelt each other on the crown\nWith silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown--\nBy all the echoes that about thee ring,\nHear us, O satyr king!\n\n  \"O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,\nWhile ever and anon to his shorn peers\nA ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,\nWhen snouted wild-boars routing tender corn\nAnger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,\nTo keep off mildews, and all weather harms:\nStrange ministrant of undescribed sounds,\nThat come a swooning over hollow grounds,\nAnd wither drearily on barren moors:\nDread opener of the mysterious doors\nLeading to universal knowledge--see,\nGreat son of Dryope,\nThe many that are come to pay their vows\nWith leaves about their brows!\n\n  Be still the unimaginable lodge\nFor solitary thinkings; such as dodge\nConception to the very bourne of heaven,\nThen leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,\nThat spreading in this dull and clodded earth\nGives it a touch ethereal--a new birth:\nBe still a symbol of immensity;\nA firmament reflected in a sea;\nAn element filling the space between;\nAn unknown--but no more: we humbly screen\nWith uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,\nAnd giving out a shout most heaven rending,\nConjure thee to receive our humble Paean,\nUpon thy Mount Lycean!\n\n  Even while they brought the burden to a close,\nA shout from the whole multitude arose,\nThat lingered in the air like dying rolls\nOf abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals\nOf dolphins bob their noses through the brine.\nMeantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,\nYoung companies nimbly began dancing\nTo the swift treble pipe, and humming string.\nAye, those fair living forms swam heavenly\nTo tunes forgotten--out of memory:\nFair creatures! whose young children's children bred\nThermopylæ its heroes--not yet dead,\nBut in old marbles ever beautiful.\nHigh genitors, unconscious did they cull\nTime's sweet first-fruits--they danc'd to weariness,\nAnd then in quiet circles did they press\nThe hillock turf, and caught the latter end\nOf some strange history, potent to send\nA young mind from its bodily tenement.\nOr they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent\nOn either side; pitying the sad death\nOf Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath\nOf Zephyr slew him,--Zephyr penitent,\nWho now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,\nFondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.\nThe archers too, upon a wider plain,\nBeside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,\nAnd the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft\nBranch down sweeping from a tall ash top,\nCall'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope\nThose who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee\nAnd frantic gape of lonely Niobe,\nPoor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young\nWere dead and gone, and her caressing tongue\nLay a lost thing upon her paly lip,\nAnd very, very deadliness did nip\nHer motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood\nBy one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,\nUplifting his strong bow into the air,\nMany might after brighter visions stare:\nAfter the Argonauts, in blind amaze\nTossing about on Neptune's restless ways,\nUntil, from the horizon's vaulted side,\nThere shot a golden splendour far and wide,\nSpangling those million poutings of the brine\nWith quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine\nFrom the exaltation of Apollo's bow;\nA heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.\nWho thus were ripe for high contemplating,\nMight turn their steps towards the sober ring\nWhere sat Endymion and the aged priest\n'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd\nThe silvery setting of their mortal star.\nThere they discours'd upon the fragile bar\nThat keeps us from our homes ethereal;\nAnd what our duties there: to nightly call\nVesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;\nTo summon all the downiest clouds together\nFor the sun's purple couch; to emulate\nIn ministring the potent rule of fate\nWith speed of fire-tailed exhalations;\nTo tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons\nSweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,\nA world of other unguess'd offices.\nAnon they wander'd, by divine converse,\nInto Elysium; vieing to rehearse\nEach one his own anticipated bliss.\nOne felt heart-certain that he could not miss\nHis quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,\nWhere every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows\nHer lips with music for the welcoming.\nAnother wish'd, mid that eternal spring,\nTo meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,\nSweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:\nWho, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,\nAnd with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;\nAnd, ever after, through those regions be\nHis messenger, his little Mercury.\nSome were athirst in soul to see again\nTheir fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign\nIn times long past; to sit with them, and talk\nOf all the chances in their earthly walk;\nComparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores\nOf happiness, to when upon the moors,\nBenighted, close they huddled from the cold,\nAnd shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told\nTheir fond imaginations,--saving him\nWhose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,\nEndymion: yet hourly had he striven\nTo hide the cankering venom, that had riven\nHis fainting recollections. Now indeed\nHis senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed\nThe sudden silence, or the whispers low,\nOr the old eyes dissolving at his woe,\nOr anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,\nOr maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:\nBut in the self-same fixed trance he kept,\nLike one who on the earth had never stept.\nAye, even as dead-still as a marble man,\nFrozen in that old tale Arabian.\n\n  Who whispers him so pantingly and close?\nPeona, his sweet sister: of all those,\nHis friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,\nAnd breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade\nA yielding up, a cradling on her care.\nHer eloquence did breathe away the curse:\nShe led him, like some midnight spirit nurse\nOf happy changes in emphatic dreams,\nAlong a path between two little streams,--\nGuarding his forehead, with her round elbow,\nFrom low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow\nFrom stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;\nUntil they came to where these streamlets fall,\nWith mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,\nInto a river, clear, brimful, and flush\nWith crystal mocking of the trees and sky.\nA little shallop, floating there hard by,\nPointed its beak over the fringed bank;\nAnd soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,\nAnd dipt again, with the young couple's weight,--\nPeona guiding, through the water straight,\nTowards a bowery island opposite;\nWhich gaining presently, she steered light\nInto a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,\nWhere nested was an arbour, overwove\nBy many a summer's silent fingering;\nTo whose cool bosom she was used to bring\nHer playmates, with their needle broidery,\nAnd minstrel memories of times gone by.\n\n  So she was gently glad to see him laid\nUnder her favourite bower's quiet shade,\nOn her own couch, new made of flower leaves,\nDried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves\nWhen last the sun his autumn tresses shook,\nAnd the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.\nSoon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:\nBut, ere it crept upon him, he had prest\nPeona's busy hand against his lips,\nAnd still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips\nIn tender pressure. And as a willow keeps\nA patient watch over the stream that creeps\nWindingly by it, so the quiet maid\nHeld her in peace: so that a whispering blade\nOf grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling\nDown in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling\nAmong seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.\n\n  O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,\nThat broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind\nTill it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd\nRestraint! imprisoned liberty! great key\nTo golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,\nFountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,\nEchoing grottos, full of tumbling waves\nAnd moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world\nOf silvery enchantment!--who, upfurl'd\nBeneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,\nBut renovates and lives?--Thus, in the bower,\nEndymion was calm'd to life again.\nOpening his eyelids with a healthier brain,\nHe said: \"I feel this thine endearing love\nAll through my bosom: thou art as a dove\nTrembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings\nAbout me; and the pearliest dew not brings\nSuch morning incense from the fields of May,\nAs do those brighter drops that twinkling stray\nFrom those kind eyes,--the very home and haunt\nOf sisterly affection. Can I want\nAught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?\nYet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears\nThat, any longer, I will pass my days\nAlone and sad. No, I will once more raise\nMy voice upon the mountain-heights; once more\nMake my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:\nAgain my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll\nAround the breathed boar: again I'll poll\nThe fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:\nAnd, when the pleasant sun is getting low,\nAgain I'll linger in a sloping mead\nTo hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed\nOur idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,\nAnd, if thy lute is here, softly intreat\nMy soul to keep in its resolved course.\"\n\n  Hereat Peona, in their silver source,\nShut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,\nAnd took a lute, from which there pulsing came\nA lively prelude, fashioning the way\nIn which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay\nMore subtle cadenced, more forest wild\nThan Dryope's lone lulling of her child;\nAnd nothing since has floated in the air\nSo mournful strange. Surely some influence rare\nWent, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;\nFor still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd\nThe quick invisible strings, even though she saw\nEndymion's spirit melt away and thaw\nBefore the deep intoxication.\nBut soon she came, with sudden burst, upon\nHer self-possession--swung the lute aside,\nAnd earnestly said: \"Brother, 'tis vain to hide\nThat thou dost know of things mysterious,\nImmortal, starry; such alone could thus\nWeigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught\nOffensive to the heavenly powers? Caught\nA Paphian dove upon a message sent?\nThy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,\nSacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen\nHer naked limbs among the alders green;\nAnd that, alas! is death. No, I can trace\nSomething more high perplexing in thy face!\"\n\n  Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,\nAnd said, \"Art thou so pale, who wast so bland\nAnd merry in our meadows? How is this?\nTell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!--\nAh! thou hast been unhappy at the change\nWrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?\nOr more complete to overwhelm surmise?\nAmbition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,\nThat toiling years would put within my grasp,\nThat I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp\nNo man e'er panted for a mortal love.\nSo all have set my heavier grief above\nThese things which happen. Rightly have they done:\nI, who still saw the horizontal sun\nHeave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,\nOut-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd\nMy spear aloft, as signal for the chace--\nI, who, for very sport of heart, would race\nWith my own steed from Araby; pluck down\nA vulture from his towery perching; frown\nA lion into growling, loth retire--\nTo lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,\nAnd sink thus low! but I will ease my breast\nOf secret grief, here in this bowery nest.\n\n  \"This river does not see the naked sky,\nTill it begins to progress silverly\nAround the western border of the wood,\nWhence, from a certain spot, its winding flood\nSeems at the distance like a crescent moon:\nAnd in that nook, the very pride of June,\nHad I been used to pass my weary eves;\nThe rather for the sun unwilling leaves\nSo dear a picture of his sovereign power,\nAnd I could witness his most kingly hour,\nWhen he doth lighten up the golden reins,\nAnd paces leisurely down amber plains\nHis snorting four. Now when his chariot last\nIts beams against the zodiac-lion cast,\nThere blossom'd suddenly a magic bed\nOf sacred ditamy, and poppies red:\nAt which I wondered greatly, knowing well\nThat but one night had wrought this flowery spell;\nAnd, sitting down close by, began to muse\nWhat it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,\nIn passing here, his owlet pinions shook;\nOr, it may be, ere matron Night uptook\nHer ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,\nHad dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth\nCame not by common growth. Thus on I thought,\nUntil my head was dizzy and distraught.\nMoreover, through the dancing poppies stole\nA breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;\nAnd shaping visions all about my sight\nOf colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;\nThe which became more strange, and strange, and dim,\nAnd then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:\nAnd then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell\nThe enchantment that afterwards befel?\nYet it was but a dream: yet such a dream\nThat never tongue, although it overteem\nWith mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,\nCould figure out and to conception bring\nAll I beheld and felt. Methought I lay\nWatching the zenith, where the milky way\nAmong the stars in virgin splendour pours;\nAnd travelling my eye, until the doors\nOf heaven appear'd to open for my flight,\nI became loth and fearful to alight\nFrom such high soaring by a downward glance:\nSo kept me stedfast in that airy trance,\nSpreading imaginary pinions wide.\nWhen, presently, the stars began to glide,\nAnd faint away, before my eager view:\nAt which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,\nAnd dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;\nAnd lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge\nThe loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er\nA shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar\nSo passionately bright, my dazzled soul\nCommingling with her argent spheres did roll\nThrough clear and cloudy, even when she went\nAt last into a dark and vapoury tent--\nWhereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train\nOf planets all were in the blue again.\nTo commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd\nMy sight right upward: but it was quite dazed\nBy a bright something, sailing down apace,\nMaking me quickly veil my eyes and face:\nAgain I look'd, and, O ye deities,\nWho from Olympus watch our destinies!\nWhence that completed form of all completeness?\nWhence came that high perfection of all sweetness?\nSpeak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where\nHast thou a symbol of her golden hair?\nNot oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;\nNot--thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun\nSuch follying before thee--yet she had,\nIndeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;\nAnd they were simply gordian'd up and braided,\nLeaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,\nHer pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;\nThe which were blended in, I know not how,\nWith such a paradise of lips and eyes,\nBlush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,\nThat, when I think thereon, my spirit clings\nAnd plays about its fancy, till the stings\nOf human neighbourhood envenom all.\nUnto what awful power shall I call?\nTo what high fane?--Ah! see her hovering feet,\nMore bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet\nThan those of sea-born Venus, when she rose\nFrom out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows\nHer scarf into a fluttering pavilion;\n'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million\nOf little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,\nOver the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,\nHandfuls of daisies.\"--\"Endymion, how strange!\nDream within dream!\"--\"She took an airy range,\nAnd then, towards me, like a very maid,\nCame blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,\nAnd press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;\nMethought I fainted at the charmed touch,\nYet held my recollection, even as one\nWho dives three fathoms where the waters run\nGurgling in beds of coral: for anon,\nI felt upmounted in that region\nWhere falling stars dart their artillery forth,\nAnd eagles struggle with the buffeting north\nThat balances the heavy meteor-stone;--\nFelt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,\nBut lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.\nSoon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,\nAnd straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;\nSuch as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd\nHuge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:\nThere hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd\nTo faint once more by looking on my bliss--\nI was distracted; madly did I kiss\nThe wooing arms which held me, and did give\nMy eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,\nTo take in draughts of life from the gold fount\nOf kind and passionate looks; to count, and count\nThe moments, by some greedy help that seem'd\nA second self, that each might be redeem'd\nAnd plunder'd of its load of blessedness.\nAh, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press\nHer very cheek against my crowned lip,\nAnd, at that moment, felt my body dip\nInto a warmer air: a moment more,\nOur feet were soft in flowers. There was store\nOf newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes\nA scent of violets, and blossoming limes,\nLoiter'd around us; then of honey cells,\nMade delicate from all white-flower bells;\nAnd once, above the edges of our nest,\nAn arch face peep'd,--an Oread as I guess'd.\n\n  \"Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me\nIn midst of all this heaven? Why not see,\nFar off, the shadows of his pinions dark,\nAnd stare them from me? But no, like a spark\nThat needs must die, although its little beam\nReflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream\nFell into nothing--into stupid sleep.\nAnd so it was, until a gentle creep,\nA careful moving caught my waking ears,\nAnd up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,\nMy clenched hands;--for lo! the poppies hung\nDew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung\nA heavy ditty, and the sullen day\nHad chidden herald Hesperus away,\nWith leaden looks: the solitary breeze\nBluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze\nWith wayward melancholy; and r thought,\nMark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought\nFaint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!--\nAway I wander'd--all the pleasant hues\nOf heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades\nWere deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades\nWere full of pestilent light; our taintless rills\nSeem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills\nOf dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown\nIn frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown\nLike spiked aloe. If an innocent bird\nBefore my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd\nIn little journeys, I beheld in it\nA disguis'd demon, missioned to knit\nMy soul with under darkness; to entice\nMy stumblings down some monstrous precipice:\nTherefore I eager followed, and did curse\nThe disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,\nRock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!\nThese things, with all their comfortings, are given\nTo my down-sunken hours, and with thee,\nSweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea\nOf weary life.\"\n\n                  Thus ended he, and both\nSat silent: for the maid was very loth\nTo answer; feeling well that breathed words\nWould all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords\nAgainst the enchased crocodile, or leaps\nOf grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,\nAnd wonders; struggles to devise some blame;\nTo put on such a look as would say, Shame\nOn this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,\nShe could as soon have crush'd away the life\nFrom a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,\nShe said with trembling chance: \"Is this the cause?\nThis all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!\nThat one who through this middle earth should pass\nMost like a sojourning demi-god, and leave\nHis name upon the harp-string, should achieve\nNo higher bard than simple maidenhood,\nSinging alone, and fearfully,--how the blood\nLeft his young cheek; and how he used to stray\nHe knew not where; and how he would say, nay,\nIf any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;\nWhat could it be but love? How a ring-dove\nLet fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;\nAnd how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,\nThe gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;\nAnd then the ballad of his sad life closes\nWith sighs, and an alas!--Endymion!\nBe rather in the trumpet's mouth,--anon\nAmong the winds at large--that all may hearken!\nAlthough, before the crystal heavens darken,\nI watch and dote upon the silver lakes\nPictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes\nThe semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,\nIslands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands\nWith horses prancing o'er them, palaces\nAnd towers of amethyst,--would I so tease\nMy pleasant days, because I could not mount\nInto those regions? The Morphean fount\nOf that fine element that visions, dreams,\nAnd fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams\nInto its airy channels with so subtle,\nSo thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,\nCircled a million times within the space\nOf a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,\nA tinting of its quality: how light\nMust dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight\nThan the mere nothing that engenders them!\nThen wherefore sully the entrusted gem\nOf high and noble life with thoughts so sick?\nWhy pierce high-fronted honour to the quick\nFor nothing but a dream?\" Hereat the youth\nLook'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth\nWas in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids\nWidened a little, as when Zephyr bids\nA little breeze to creep between the fans\nOf careless butterflies: amid his pains\nHe seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,\nFull palatable; and a colour grew\nUpon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.\n\n  \"Peona! ever have I long'd to slake\nMy thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,\nNo merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace\nThe stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd--\nThough now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd\nAnd sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope\nIs of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,\nTo fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.\nWherein lies happiness? In that which becks\nOur ready minds to fellowship divine,\nA fellowship with essence; till we shine,\nFull alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold\nThe clear religion of heaven! Fold\nA rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,\nAnd soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress\nOf music's kiss impregnates the free winds,\nAnd with a sympathetic touch unbinds\nEolian magic from their lucid wombs:\nThen old songs waken from enclouded tombs;\nOld ditties sigh above their father's grave;\nGhosts of melodious prophecyings rave\nRound every spot where trod Apollo's foot;\nBronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,\nWhere long ago a giant battle was;\nAnd, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass\nIn every place where infant Orpheus slept.\nFeel we these things?--that moment have we stept\nInto a sort of oneness, and our state\nIs like a floating spirit's. But there are\nRicher entanglements, enthralments far\nMore self-destroying, leading, by degrees,\nTo the chief intensity: the crown of these\nIs made of love and friendship, and sits high\nUpon the forehead of humanity.\nAll its more ponderous and bulky worth\nIs friendship, whence there ever issues forth\nA steady splendour; but at the tip-top,\nThere hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop\nOf light, and that is love: its influence,\nThrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,\nAt which we start and fret; till in the end,\nMelting into its radiance, we blend,\nMingle, and so become a part of it,--\nNor with aught else can our souls interknit\nSo wingedly: when we combine therewith,\nLife's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,\nAnd we are nurtured like a pelican brood.\nAye, so delicious is the unsating food,\nThat men, who might have tower'd in the van\nOf all the congregated world, to fan\nAnd winnow from the coming step of time\nAll chaff of custom, wipe away all slime\nLeft by men-slugs and human serpentry,\nHave been content to let occasion die,\nWhilst they did sleep in love's elysium.\nAnd, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,\nThan speak against this ardent listlessness:\nFor I have ever thought that it might bless\nThe world with benefits unknowingly;\nAs does the nightingale, upperched high,\nAnd cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves--\nShe sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives\nHow tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.\nJust so may love, although 'tis understood\nThe mere commingling of passionate breath,\nProduce more than our searching witnesseth:\nWhat I know not: but who, of men, can tell\nThat flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell\nTo melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,\nThe earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,\nThe meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,\nThe seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,\nTones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,\nIf human souls did never kiss and greet?\n\n  \"Now, if this earthly love has power to make\nMen's being mortal, immortal; to shake\nAmbition from their memories, and brim\nTheir measure of content; what merest whim,\nSeems all this poor endeavour after fame,\nTo one, who keeps within his stedfast aim\nA love immortal, an immortal too.\nLook not so wilder'd; for these things are true,\nAnd never can be born of atomies\nThat buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,\nLeaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,\nMy restless spirit never could endure\nTo brood so long upon one luxury,\nUnless it did, though fearfully, espy\nA hope beyond the shadow of a dream.\nMy sayings will the less obscured seem,\nWhen I have told thee how my waking sight\nHas made me scruple whether that same night\nWas pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!\nBeyond the matron-temple of Latona,\nWhich we should see but for these darkening boughs,\nLies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows\nBushes and trees do lean all round athwart,\nAnd meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,\nAnd spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide\nPast them, but he must brush on every side.\nSome moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,\nFar as the slabbed margin of a well,\nWhose patient level peeps its crystal eye\nRight upward, through the bushes, to the sky.\nOft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set\nLike vestal primroses, but dark velvet\nEdges them round, and they have golden pits:\n'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits\nIn a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,\nWhen all above was faint with mid-day heat.\nAnd there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,\nI'd bubble up the water through a reed;\nSo reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships\nOf moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,\nWith leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be\nOf their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,\nWhen love-lorn hours had left me less a child,\nI sat contemplating the figures wild\nOf o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.\nUpon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew\nA cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;\nSo plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver\nThe happy chance: so happy, I was fain\nTo follow it upon the open plain,\nAnd, therefore, was just going; when, behold!\nA wonder, fair as any I have told--\nThe same bright face I tasted in my sleep,\nSmiling in the clear well. My heart did leap\nThrough the cool depth.--It moved as if to flee--\nI started up, when lo! refreshfully,\nThere came upon my face, in plenteous showers,\nDew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,\nWrapping all objects from my smothered sight,\nBathing my spirit in a new delight.\nAye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss\nAlone preserved me from the drear abyss\nOf death, for the fair form had gone again.\nPleasure is oft a visitant; but pain\nClings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth\nOn the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,\n'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.\nHow sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure\nOf weary days, made deeper exquisite,\nBy a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!\nLike sorrow came upon me, heavier still,\nThan when I wander'd from the poppy hill:\nAnd a whole age of lingering moments crept\nSluggishly by, ere more contentment swept\nAway at once the deadly yellow spleen.\nYes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;\nOnce more been tortured with renewed life.\nWhen last the wintry gusts gave over strife\nWith the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies\nWarm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes\nIn pity of the shatter'd infant buds,--\nThat time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,\nMy hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,\nChatted with thee, and many days exil'd\nAll torment from my breast;--'twas even then,\nStraying about, yet, coop'd up in the den\nOf helpless discontent,--hurling my lance\nFrom place to place, and following at chance,\nAt last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,\nAnd, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck\nIn the middle of a brook,--whose silver ramble\nDown twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,\nTracing along, it brought me to a cave,\nWhence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave\nThe nether sides of mossy stones and rock,--\n'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock\nIts own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,\nHung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread\nThick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.\n\"Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?\"\nSaid I, low voic'd: \"Ah whither! 'Tis the grot\nOf Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,\nDoth her resign; and where her tender hands\nShe dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:\nOr 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,\nAnd babbles thorough silence, till her wits\nAre gone in tender madness, and anon,\nFaints into sleep, with many a dying tone\nOf sadness. O that she would take my vows,\nAnd breathe them sighingly among the boughs,\nTo sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,\nDaily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,\nAnd weave them dyingly--send honey-whispers\nRound every leaf, that all those gentle lispers\nMay sigh my love unto her pitying!\nO charitable echo! hear, and sing\nThis ditty to her!--tell her\"--so I stay'd\nMy foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,\nStood stupefied with my own empty folly,\nAnd blushing for the freaks of melancholy.\nSalt tears were coming, when I heard my name\nMost fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:\n‘Endymion! the cave is secreter\nThan the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir\nNo sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise\nOf thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys\nAnd trembles through my labyrinthine hair.\"\nAt that oppress'd I hurried in.--Ah! where\nAre those swift moments? Whither are they fled?\nI'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed\nSorrow the way to death, but patiently\nBear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;\nAnd come instead demurest meditation,\nTo occupy me wholly, and to fashion\nMy pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.\nNo more will I count over, link by link,\nMy chain of grief: no longer strive to find\nA half-forgetfulness in mountain wind\nBlustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,\nDearest of sisters, what my life shall be;\nWhat a calm round of hours shall make my days.\nThere is a paly flame of hope that plays\nWhere'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naught--\nAnd here I bid it die. Have not I caught,\nAlready, a more healthy countenance?\nBy this the sun is setting; we may chance\nMeet some of our near-dwellers with my car.\"\n\n  This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star\nThrough autumn mists, and took Peona's hand:\nThey stept into the boat, and launch'd from land."},{"title":"Ode To Autumn","author":"John Keats","text":"Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,\nClose bosom-friend of the maturing sun;\nConspiring with him how to load and bless\nWith fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;\nTo bend with apples the mossed cottage-trees,\nAnd fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;\nTo swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells\nWith a sweet kernel; to set budding more,\nAnd still more, later flowers for the bees,\nUntil they think warm days will never cease,\nFor Summer has o'er-brimmed their clammy cell.\n\nWho hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?\nSometimes whoever seeks abroad may find\nThee sitting careless on a granary floor,\nThy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;\nOr on a half-reaped furrow sound asleep,\nDrowsed with the fume of poppies, while thy hook\nSpares the next swath and all its twined flowers;\nAnd sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep\nSteady thy laden head across a brook;\nOr by a cider-press, with patient look,\nThou watchest the last oozings, hours by hours.\n\nWhere are the songs of Spring?

No stir of air was there,\nNot so much life as on a summer's day\nRobs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,\nBut where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.\nA stream went voiceless by, still deadened more\nBy reason of his fallen divinity\nSpreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds\nPress'd her cold finger closer to her lips.\n\n     Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went,\nNo further than to where his feet had stray'd,\nAnd slept there since.  Upon the sodden ground\nHis old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead,\nUnsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed;\nWhile his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth,\nHis ancient mother, for some comfort yet.\n\n     It seem'd no force could wake him from his place;\nBut there came one, who with a kindred hand\nTouch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low\nWith reverence, though to one who knew it not.\nShe was a Goddess of the infant world;\nBy her in stature the tall Amazon\nHad stood a pigmy's height: she would have ta'en\nAchilles by the hair and bent his neck;\nOr with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel.\nHer face was large as that of Memphian sphinx,\nPedestal'd haply in a palace court,\nWhen sages look'd to Egypt for their lore.\nBut oh! how unlike marble was that face:\nHow beautiful, if sorrow had not made\nSorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.\nThere was a listening fear in her regard,\nAs if calamity had but begun;\nAs if the vanward clouds of evil days\nHad spent their malice, and the sullen rear\nWas with its stored thunder labouring up.\nOne hand she press'd upon that aching spot\nWhere beats the human heart, as if just there,\nThough an immortal, she felt cruel pain:\nThe other upon Saturn's bended neck\nShe laid, and to the level of his ear\nLeaning with parted lips, some words she spake\nIn solemn tenor and deep organ tone:\nSome mourning words, which in our feeble tongue\nWould come in these like accents; O how frail\nTo that large utterance of the early Gods!\n\"Saturn, look up!---though wherefore, poor old King?\nI have no comfort for thee, no not one:\nI cannot say, 'O wherefore sleepest thou?'\nFor heaven is parted from thee, and the earth\nKnows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God;\nAnd ocean too, with all its solemn noise,\nHas from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air\nIs emptied of thine hoary majesty.\nThy thunder, conscious of the new command,\nRumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;\nAnd thy sharp lightning in unpractised hands\nScorches and burns our once serene domain.\nO aching time! O moments big as years!\nAll as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,\nAnd press it so upon our weary griefs\nThat unbelief has not a space to breathe.\nSaturn, sleep on:---O thoughtless, why did I\nThus violate thy slumbrous solitude?\nWhy should I ope thy melancholy eyes?\nSaturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.\"\n\n     As when, upon a tranced summer-night,\nThose green-rob'd senators of mighty woods,\nTall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars,\nDream, and so dream all night without a stir,\nSave from one gradual solitary gust\nWhich comes upon the silence, and dies off,\nAs if the ebbing air had but one wave;\nSo came these words and went; the while in tears\nShe touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground,\nJust where her fallen hair might be outspread\nA soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet.\nOne moon, with alteration slow, had shed\nHer silver seasons four upon the night,\nAnd still these two were postured motionless,\nLike natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;\nThe frozen God still couchant on the earth,\nAnd the sad Goddess weeping at his feet:\nUntil at length old Saturn lifted up\nHis faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone,\nAnd all the gloom and sorrow ofthe place,\nAnd that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake,\nAs with a palsied tongue, and while his beard\nShook horrid with such aspen-malady:\n\"O tender spouse of gold Hyperion,\nThea, I feel thee ere I see thy face;\nLook up, and let me see our doom in it;\nLook up, and tell me if this feeble shape\nIs Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice\nOf Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow,\nNaked and bare of its great diadem,\nPeers like the front of Saturn? Who had power\nTo make me desolate? Whence came the strength?\nHow was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth,\nWhile Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp?\nBut it is so; and I am smother'd up,\nAnd buried from all godlike exercise\nOf influence benign on planets pale,\nOf admonitions to the winds and seas,\nOf peaceful sway above man's harvesting,\nAnd all those acts which Deity supreme\nDoth ease its heart of love in.---I am gone\nAway from my own bosom: I have left\nMy strong identity, my real self,\nSomewhere between the throne, and where I sit\nHere on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search!\nOpen thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round\nUpon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light;\nSpace region'd with life-air; and barren void;\nSpaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.---\nSearch, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest\nA certain shape or shadow, making way\nWith wings or chariot fierce to repossess\nA heaven he lost erewhile: it must---it must\nBe of ripe progress---Saturn must be King.\nYes, there must be a golden victory;\nThere must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown\nOf triumph calm, and hymns of festival\nUpon the gold clouds metropolitan,\nVoices of soft proclaim, and silver stir\nOf strings in hollow shells; and there shall be\nBeautiful things made new, for the surprise\nOf the sky-children; I will give command:\nThea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?\"\nThis passion lifted him upon his feet,\nAnd made his hands to struggle in the air,\nHis Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat,\nHis eyes to fever out, his voice to cease.\nHe stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep;\nA little time, and then again he snatch'd\nUtterance thus.---\"But cannot I create?\nCannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth\nAnother world, another universe,\nTo overbear and crumble this to nought?\nWhere is another Chaos? Where?\"---That word\nFound way unto Olympus, and made quake\nThe rebel three.---Thea was startled up,\nAnd in her bearing was a sort of hope,\nAs thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe.\n\n     \"This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends,\nO Saturn! come away, and give them heart;\nI know the covert, for thence came I hither.\"\nThus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went\nWith backward footing through the shade a space:\nHe follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way\nThrough aged boughs, that yielded like the mist\nWhich eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.\n\n     Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,\nMore sorrow like to this, and such like woe,\nToo huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:\nThe Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound,\nGroan'd for the old allegiance once more,\nAnd listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice.\nBut one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept\nHis sov'reigny, and rule, and majesy;---\nBlazing Hyperion on his orbed fire\nStill sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up\nFrom man to the sun's God: yet unsecure:\nFor as among us mortals omens drear\nFright and perplex, so also shuddered he---\nNot at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech,\nOr the familiar visiting of one\nUpon the first toll of his passing-bell,\nOr prophesyings of the midnight lamp;\nBut horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve,\nOft made Hyperion ache.  His palace bright,\nBastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,\nAnd touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks,\nGlar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts,\nArches, and domes, and fiery galleries;\nAnd all its curtains of Aurorian clouds\nFlush'd angerly: while sometimes eagles' wings,\nUnseen before by Gods or wondering men,\nDarken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard\nNot heard before by Gods or wondering men.\nAlso, when he would taste the spicy wreaths\nOf incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills,\nInstead of sweets, his ample palate took\nSavor of poisonous brass and metal sick:\nAnd so, when harbor'd in the sleepy west,\nAfter the full completion of fair day,---\nFor rest divine upon exalted couch,\nAnd slumber in the arms of melody,\nHe pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease\nWith stride colossal, on from hall to hall;\nWhile far within each aisle and deep recess,\nHis winged minions in close clusters stood,\nAmaz'd and full offear; like anxious men\nWho on wide plains gather in panting troops,\nWhen earthquakes jar their battlements and towers.\nEven now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance,\nWent step for step with Thea through the woods,\nHyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,\nCame slope upon the threshold of the west;\nThen, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope\nIn smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes,\nBlown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet\nAnd wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies;\nAnd like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,\nIn fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye,\nThat inlet to severe magnificence\nStood full blown, for the God to enter in.\n\n     He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath;\nHis flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,\nAnd gave a roar, as if of earthly fire,\nThat scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours\nAnd made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared\nFrom stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,\nThrough bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light,\nAnd diamond-paved lustrous long arcades,\nUntil he reach'd the great main cupola;\nThere standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot,\nAnd from the basements deep to the high towers\nJarr'd his own golden region; and before\nThe quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,\nHis voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,\nTo this result: \"O dreams of day and night!\nO monstrous forms! O effigies of pain!\nO spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!\nO lank-eared phantoms of black-weeded pools!\nWhy do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why\nIs my eternal essence thus distraught\nTo see and to behold these horrors new?\nSaturn is fallen, am I too to fall?\nAm I to leave this haven of my rest,\nThis cradle of my glory, this soft clime,\nThis calm luxuriance of blissful light,\nThese crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes,\nOf all my lucent empire?  It is left\nDeserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.\nThe blaze, the splendor, and the symmetry,\nI cannot see but darkness, death, and darkness.\nEven here, into my centre of repose,\nThe shady visions come to domineer,\nInsult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.---\nFall!---No, by Tellus and her briny robes!\nOver the fiery frontier of my realms\nI will advance a terrible right arm\nShall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove,\nAnd bid old Saturn take his throne again.\"---\nHe spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat\nHeld struggle with his throat but came not forth;\nFor as in theatres of crowded men\nHubbub increases more they call out \"Hush!\"\nSo at Hyperion's words the phantoms pale\nBestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold;\nAnd from the mirror'd level where he stood\nA mist arose, as from a scummy marsh.\nAt this, through all his bulk an agony\nCrept gradual, from the feet unto the crown,\nLike a lithe serpent vast and muscular\nMaking slow way, with head and neck convuls'd\nFrom over-strained might.  Releas'd, he fled\nTo the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours\nBefore the dawn in season due should blush,\nHe breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals,\nClear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide\nSuddenly on the ocean's chilly streams.\nThe planet orb of fire, whereon he rode\nEach day from east to west the heavens through,\nSpun round in sable curtaining of clouds;\nNot therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid,\nBut ever and anon the glancing spheres,\nCircles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure,\nGlow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark\nSweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep\nUp to the zenith,---hieroglyphics old,\nWhich sages and keen-eyed astrologers\nThen living on the earth, with laboring thought\nWon from the gaze of many centuries:\nNow lost, save what we find on remnants huge\nOf stone, or rnarble swart; their import gone,\nTheir wisdom long since fled.---Two wings this orb\nPossess'd for glory, two fair argent wings,\nEver exalted at the God's approach:\nAnd now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense\nRose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;\nWhile still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,\nAwaiting for Hyperion's command.\nFain would he have commanded, fain took throne\nAnd bid the day begin, if but for change.\nHe might not:---No, though a primeval God:\nThe sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.\nTherefore the operations of the dawn\nStay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told.\nThose silver wings expanded sisterly,\nEager to sail their orb; the porches wide\nOpen'd upon the dusk demesnes of night\nAnd the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes,\nUnus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent\nHis spirit to the sorrow of the time;\nAnd all along a dismal rack of clouds,\nUpon the boundaries of day and night,\nHe stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.\nThere as he lay, the Heaven with its stars\nLook'd down on him with pity, and the voice\nOf Coelus, from the universal space,\nThus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear:\n\"O brightest of my children dear, earth-born\nAnd sky-engendered, son of mysteries\nAll unrevealed even to the powers\nWhich met at thy creating; at whose joys\nAnd palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft,\nI, Coelus, wonder, how they came and whence;\nAnd at the fruits thereof what shapes they be,\nDistinct, and visible; symbols divine,\nManifestations of that beauteous life\nDiffus'd unseen throughout eternal space:\nOf these new-form'd art thou, O brightest child!\nOf these, thy brethren and the Goddesses!\nThere is sad feud among ye, and rebellion\nOf son against his sire.  I saw him fall,\nI saw my first-born tumbled from his throne!\nTo me his arms were spread, to me his voice\nFound way from forth the thunders round his head!\nPale wox I, and in vapours hid my face.\nArt thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:\nFor I have seen my sons most unlike Gods.\nDivine ye were created, and divine\nIn sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,\nUnruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled:\nNow I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath;\nActions of rage and passion; even as\nI see them, on the mortal world beneath,\nIn men who die.---This is the grief, O son!\nSad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall!\nYet do thou strive; as thou art capable,\nAs thou canst move about, an evident God;\nAnd canst oppose to each malignant hour\nEthereal presence:---I am but a voice;\nMy life is but the life of winds and tides,\nNo more than winds and tides can I avail:---\nBut thou canst.---Be thou therefore in the van\nOf circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb\nBefore the tense string murmur.---To the earth!\nFor there thou wilt find Saturn, and his woes.\nMeantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,\nAnd of thy seasons be a careful nurse.\"---\nEre half this region-whisper had come down,\nHyperion arose, and on the stars\nLifted his curved lids, and kept them wide\nUntil it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide:\nAnd still they were the same bright, patient stars.\nThen with a slow incline of his broad breast,\nLike to a diver in the pearly seas,\nForward he stoop'd over the airy shore,\nAnd plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.\n\n\nBOOK II\n\nJust at the self-same beat of Time's wide wings\nHyperion slid into the rustled air,\nAnd Saturn gain'd with Thea that sad place\nWhere Cybele and the bruised Titans mourn'd.\nIt was a den where no insulting light\nCould glimmer on their tears; where their own groans\nThey felt, but heard not, for the solid roar\nOf thunderous waterfalls and torrents hoarse,\nPouring a constant bulk, uncertain where.\nCrag jutting forth to crag, and rocks that seem'd\nEver as if just rising from a sleep,\nForehead to forehead held their monstrous horns;\nAnd thus in thousand hugest phantasies\nMade a fit roofing to this nest of woe.\nInstead of thrones, hard flint they sat upon,\nCouches of rugged stone, and slaty ridge\nStubborn'd with iron.  All were not assembled:\nSome chain'd in torture, and some wandering.\nCaus, and Gyges, and Briareus,\nTyphon, and Dolor, and Porphyrion,\nWith many more, the brawniest in assault,\nWere pent in regions of laborious breath;\nDungeon'd in opaque element, to keep\nTheir clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs\nLock'd up like veins of metal, crampt and screw'd;\nWithout a motion, save of their big hearts\nHeaving in pain, and horribly convuls'd\nWith sanguine feverous boiling gurge of pulse.\nMnemosyne was straying in the world;\nFar from her moon had Phoebe wandered;\nAnd many else were free to roam abroad,\nBut for the main, here found they covert drear.\nScarce images of life, one here, one there,\nLay vast and edgeways; like a dismal cirque\nOf Druid stones, upon a forlorn moor,\nWhen the chill rain begins at shut of eve,\nIn dull November, and their chancel vault,\nThe Heaven itself, is blinded throughout night.\nEach one kept shroud, nor to his neighbour gave\nOr word, or look, or action of despair.\nCreus was one; his ponderous iron mace\nLay by him, and a shatter'd rib of rock\nTold of his rage, ere he thus sank and pined.\nIapetus another; in his grasp,\nA serpent's plashy neck; its barbed tongue\nSqueez'd from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length\nDead: and because the creature could not spit\nIts poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.\nNext Cottus: prone he lay, chin uppermost,\nAs though in pain; for still upon the flint\nHe ground severe his skull, with open mouth\nAnd eyes at horrid working.  Nearest him\nAsia, born of most enormous Caf,\nWho cost her mother Tellus keener pangs,\nThough feminine, than any of her sons:\nMore thought than woe was in her dusky face,\nFor she was prophesying of her glory;\nAnd in her wide imagination stood\nPalm-shaded temples, and high rival fanes\nBy Oxus or in Ganges' sacred isles.\nEven as Hope upon her anchor leans,\nSo leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk\nShed from the broadest of her elephants.\nAbove her, on a crag's uneasy shelve,\nUpon his elbow rais'd, all prostrate else,\nShadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild\nAs grazing ox unworried in the meads;\nNow tiger-passion'd, lion-thoughted, wroth,\nHe meditated, plotted, and even now\nWas hurling mountains in that second war,\nNot long delay'd, that scar'd the younger Gods\nTo hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.\nNot far hence Atlas; and beside him prone\nPhorcus, the sire of Gorgons.  Neighbour'd close\nOceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap\nSobb'd Clymene among her tangled hair.\nIn midst of all lay Themis, at the feet\nOf Ops the queen; all clouded round from sight,\nNo shape distinguishable, more than when\nThick night confounds the pine-tops with the clouds:\nAnd many else whose names may not be told.\nFor when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,\nWho shall delay her flight? And she must chaunt\nOf Saturn, and his guide, who now had climb'd\nWith damp and slippery footing from a depth\nMore horrid still. Above a sombre cliff\nTheir heads appear'd, and up their stature grew\nTill on the level height their steps found ease:\nThen Thea spread abroad her trembling arms\nUpon the precincts of this nest of pain,\nAnd sidelong fix'd her eye on Saturn's face:\nThere saw she direst strife; the supreme God\nAt war with all the frailty of grief,\nOf rage, of fear, anxiety, revenge,\nRemorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.\nAgainst these plagues he strove in vain; for Fate\nHad pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,\nA disanointing poison: so that Thea,\nAffrighted, kept her still, and let him pass\nFirst onwards in, among the fallen tribe.\n\n     As with us mortal men, the laden heart\nIs persecuted more, and fever'd more,\nWhen it is nighing to the mournful house\nWhere other hearts are sick of the same bruise;\nSo Saturn, as he walk'd into the midst,\nFelt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,\nBut that he met Enceladus's eye,\nWhose mightiness, and awe of him, at once\nCame like an inspiration; and he shouted,\n\"Titans, behold your God!\" at which some groan'd;\nSome started on their feet; some also shouted;\nSome wept, some wail'd, all bow'd with reverence;\nAnd Ops, uplifting her black folded veil,\nShow'd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,\nHer eye-brows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.\nThere is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines\nWhen Winter lifts his voice; there is a noise\nAmong immortals when a God gives sign,\nWith hushing finger, how he means to load\nHis tongue with the filll weight of utterless thought,\nWith thunder, and with music, and with pomp:\nSuch noise is like the roar of bleak-grown pines;\nWhich, when it ceases in this mountain'd world,\nNo other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,\nAmong these fallen, Saturn's voice therefrom\nGrew up like organ, that begins anew\nIts strain, when other harmonies, stopt short,\nLeave the dinn'd air vibrating silverly.\nThus grew it up---\"Not in my own sad breast,\nWhich is its own great judge and searcher out,\nCan I find reason why ye should be thus:\nNot in the legends of the first of days,\nStudied from that old spirit-leaved book\nWhich starry Uranus with finger bright\nSav'd from the shores of darkness, when the waves\nLow-ebb'd still hid it up in shallow gloom;---\nAnd the which book ye know I ever kept\nFor my firm-based footstool:---Ah, infirm!\nNot there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent\nOf element, earth, water, air, and fire,---\nAt war, at peace, or inter-quarreling\nOne against one, or two, or three, or all\nEach several one against the other three,\nAs fire with air loud warring when rain-floods\nDrown both, and press them both against earth's face,\nWhere, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath\nUnhinges the poor world;---not in that strife,\nWherefrom I take strange lore, and read it deep,\nCan I find reason why ye should be thus:\nNo, nowhere can unriddle, though I search,\nAnd pore on Nature's universal scroll\nEven to swooning, why ye, Divinities,\nThe first-born of all shap'd and palpable Gods,\nShould cower beneath what, in comparison,\nIs untremendous might. Yet ye are here,\nO'erwhelm'd, and spurn'd, and batter'd, ye are here!\nO Titans, shall I say 'Arise!'---Ye groan:\nShall I say 'Crouch!'---Ye groan. What can I then?\nO Heaven wide! O unseen parent dear!\nWhat can I? Tell me, all ye brethren Gods,\nHow we can war, how engine our great wrath!\nO speak your counsel now, for Saturn's ear\nIs all a-hunger'd. Thou, Oceanus,\nPonderest high and deep; and in thy face\nI see, astonied, that severe content\nWhich comes of thought and musing: give us help!\"\n\n     So ended Saturn; and the God of the sea,\nSophist and sage, from no Athenian grove,\nBut cogitation in his watery shades,\nArose, with locks not oozy, and began,\nIn murmurs, which his first-endeavouring tongue\nCaught infant-like from the far-foamed sands.\n\"O ye, whom wrath consumes!  who, passion-stung,\nWrithe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!\nShut up your senses, stifle up your ears,\nMy voice is not a bellows unto ire.\nYet listen, ye who will, whilst I bring proof\nHow ye, perforce, must be content to stoop:\nAnd in the proof much comfort will I give,\nIf ye will take that comfort in its truth.\nWe fall by course of Nature's law, not force\nOf thunder, or of Jove. Great Saturn, thou\nHast sifted well the atom-universe;\nBut for this reason, that thou art the King,\nAnd only blind from sheer supremacy,\nOne avenue was shaded from thine eyes,\nThrough which I wandered to eternal truth.\nAnd first, as thou wast not the first of powers,\nSo art thou not the last; it cannot be:\nThou art not the beginning nor the end.\nFrom Chaos and parental Darkness came\nLight, the first fruits of that intestine broil,\nThat sullen ferment, which for wondrous ends\nWas ripening in itself.  The ripe hour came,\nAnd with it Light, and Light, engendering\nUpon its own producer, forthwith touch'd\nThe whole enormous matter into life.\nUpon that very hour, our parentage,\nThe Heavens and the Earth, were manifest:\nThen thou first born, and we the giant race,\nFound ourselves ruling new and beauteous realms.\nNow comes the pain of truth, to whom 'tis pain;\nO folly! for to bear all naked truths,\nAnd to envisage circumstance, all calm,\nThat is the top of sovereignty.  Mark well!\nAs Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far\nThan Chaos and blank Darkness, though once chiefs;\nAnd as we show beyond that Heaven and Earth\nIn form and shape compact and beautiful,\nIn will, in action free, companionship,\nAnd thousand other signs of purer life;\nSo on our heels a fresh perfection treads,\nA power more strong in beauty, born of us\nAnd fated to excel us, as we pass\nIn glory that old Darkness: nor are we\nThereby more conquer'd, than by us the rule\nOf shapeless Chaos. Say, doth the dull soil\nQuarrel with the proud forests it hath fed,\nAnd feedeth still, more comely than itself?\nCan it deny the chiefdom of green groves?\nOr shall the tree be envious of the dove\nBecause it cooeth, and hath snowy wings\nTo wander wherewithal and find its joys?\nWe are such forest-trees, and our fair boughs\nHave bred forth, not pale solitary doves,\nBut eagles golden-feather'd, who do tower\nAbove us in their beauty, and must reign\nIn right thereof; for 'tis the eternal law\nThat first in beauty should be first in might:\nYea, by that law, another race may drive\nOur conquerors to mourn as we do now.\nHave ye beheld the young God of the seas,\nMy dispossessor? Have ye seen his face?\nHave ye beheld his chariot, foam'd along\nBy noble winged creatures he hath made?\nI saw him on the calmed waters scud,\nWith such a glow of beauty in his eyes,\nThat it enforc'd me to bid sad farewell\nTo all my empire: farewell sad I took,\nAnd hither came, to see how dolorous fate\nHad wrought upon ye; and how I might best\nGive consolation in this woe extreme.\nReceive the truth, and let it be your balm.\"\n\n     Whether through pos'd conviction, or disdain,\nThey guarded silence, when Oceanus\nLeft murmuring, what deepest thought can tell?\nBut so it was, none answer'd for a space,\nSave one whom none regarded, Clymene;\nAnd yet she answer'd not, only complain'd,\nWith hectic lips, and eyes up-looking mild,\nThus wording timidly among the fierce:\n\"O Father! I am here the simplest voice,\nAnd all my knowledge is that joy is gone,\nAnd this thing woe crept in among our hearts,\nThere to remain for ever, as I fear:\nI would not bode of evil, if I thought\nSo weak a creature could turn off the help\nWhich by just right should come of mighty Gods;\nYet let me tell my sorrow, let me tell\nOf what I heard, and how it made me weep,\nAnd know that we had parted from all hope.\nI stood upon a shore, a pleasant shore,\nWhere a sweet clime was breathed from a land\nOf fragrance, quietness, and trees, and flowers.\nFull of calm joy it was, as I of grief;\nToo full of joy and soft delicious warmth;\nSo that I felt a movement in my heart\nTo chide, and to reproach that solitude\nWith songs of misery, music of our woes;\nAnd sat me down, and took a mouthed shell\nAnd murmur'd into it, and made melody---\nO melody no more! for while I sang,\nAnd with poor skill let pass into the breeze\nThe dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand\nJust opposite, an island of the sea,\nThere came enchantment with the shifting wind,\nThat did both drown and keep alive my ears.\nI threw my shell away upon the sand,\nAnd a wave fill'd it, as my sense was fill'd\nWith that new blissful golden melody.\nA living death was in each gush of sounds,\nEach family of rapturous hurried notes,\nThat fell, one after one, yet all at once,\nLike pearl beads dropping sudden from their string:\nAnd then another, then another strain,\nEach like a dove leaving its olive perch,\nWith music wing'd instead of silent plumes,\nTo hover round my head, and make me sick\nOf joy and grief at once.  Grief overcame,\nAnd I was stopping up my frantic ears,\nWhen, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,\nA voice came sweeter, sweeter than all tune,\nAnd still it cried, 'Apollo! young Apollo!\nThe morning-bright Apollo! young Apollo!'\nI fled, it follow'd me, and cried 'Apollo!'\nO Father, and O Brethren, had ye felt\nThose pains of mine; O Saturn, hadst thou felt,\nYe would not call this too indulged tongue\nPresumptuous, in thus venturing to be heard.\"\n\n     So far her voice flow'd on, like timorous brook\nThat, lingering along a pebbled coast,\nDoth fear to meet the sea: but sea it met,\nAnd shudder'd; for the overwhelming voice\nOf huge Enceladus swallow'd it in wrath:\nThe ponderous syllables, like sullen waves\nIn the half-glutted hollows of reef-rocks,\nCame booming thus, while still upon his arm\nHe lean'd; not rising, from supreme contempt.\n\"Or shall we listen to the over-wise,\nOr to the over-foolish, Giant-Gods?\nNot thunderbolt on thunderbolt, till all\nThat rebel Jove's whole armoury were spent,\nNot world on world upon these shoulders piled,\nCould agonize me more than baby-words\nIn midst of this dethronement horrible.\nSpeak! roar! shout! yell! ye sleepy Titans all.\nDo ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?\nAre ye not smitten by a youngling arm?\nDost thou forget, sham Monarch of the waves,\nThy scalding in the seas?  What! have I rous'd\nYour spleens with so few simple words as these?\nO joy! for now I see ye are not lost:\nO joy! for now I see a thousand eyes\nWide-glaring for revenge!\"---As this he said,\nHe lifted up his stature vast, and stood,\nStill without intermission speaking thus:\n\"Now ye are flames, I'll tell you how to burn,\nAnd purge the ether of our enemies;\nHow to feed fierce the crooked stings of fire,\nAnd singe away the swollen clouds of Jove,\nStifling that puny essence in its tent.\nO let him feel the evil he hath done;\nFor though I scorn Oceanus's lore,\nMuch pain have I for more than loss of realms:\nThe days of peace and slumbrous calm are fled;\nThose days, all innocent of scathing war,\nWhen all the fair Existences of heaven\nCarne open-eyed to guess what we would speak:---\nThat was before our brows were taught to frown,\nBefore our lips knew else but solemn sounds;\nThat was before we knew the winged thing,\nVictory, might be lost, or might be won.\nAnd be ye mindful that Hyperion,\nOur brightest brother, still is undisgraced---\nHyperion, lo! his radiance is here!\"\n\n     All eyes were on Enceladus's face,\nAnd they beheld, while still Hyperion's name\nFlew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,\nA pallid gleam across his features stern:\nNot savage, for he saw full many a God\nWroth as himself.  He look'd upon them all,\nAnd in each face he saw a gleam of light,\nBut splendider in Saturn's, whose hoar locks\nShone like the bubbling foam about a keel\nWhen the prow sweeps into a midnight cove.\nIn pale and silver silence they remain'd,\nTill suddenly a splendor, like the morn,\nPervaded all the beetling gloomy steeps,\nAll the sad spaces of oblivion,\nAnd every gulf, and every chasm old,\nAnd every height, and every sullen depth,\nVoiceless, or hoarse with loud tormented streams:\nAnd all the everlasting cataracts,\nAnd all the headlong torrents far and near,\nMantled before in darkness and huge shade,\nNow saw the light and made it terrible.\nIt was Hyperion:---a granite peak\nHis bright feet touch'd, and there he stay'd to view\nThe misery his brilliance had betray'd\nTo the most hateful seeing of itself.\nGolden his hair of short Numidian curl,\nRegal his shape majestic, a vast shade\nIn midst of his own brightness, like the bulk\nOf Memnon's image at the set of sun\nTo one who travels from the dusking East:\nSighs, too, as mournful as that Memnon's harp\nHe utter'd, while his hands contemplative\nHe press'd together, and in silence stood.\nDespondence seiz'd again the fallen Gods\nAt sight of the dejected King of day,\nAnd many hid their faces from the light:\nBut fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes\nAmong the brotherhood; and, at their glare,\nUprose Iapetus, and Creus too,\nAnd Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode\nTo where he towered on his eminence.\nThere those four shouted forth old Saturn's name;\nHyperion from the peak loud answered, \"Saturn!\"\nSaturn sat near the Mother of the Gods,\nIn whose face was no joy, though all the Gods\nGave from their hollow throats the name of \"Saturn!\"\n\n\nBOOK III\n\nThus in altemate uproar and sad peace,\nAmazed were those Titans utterly.\nO leave them, Muse!  O leave them to their woes;\nFor thou art weak to sing such tumults dire:\nA solitary sorrow best befits\nThy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.\nLeave them, O Muse! for thou anon wilt find\nMany a fallen old Divinity\nWandering in vain about bewildered shores.\nMeantime touch piously the Delphic harp,\nAnd not a wind of heaven but will breathe\nIn aid soft warble from the Dorian flute;\nFor lo! 'tis for the Father of all verse.\nFlush everything that hath a vermeil hue,\nLet the rose glow intense and warm the air,\nAnd let the clouds of even and of morn\nFloat in voluptuous fleeces o'er the hills;\nLet the red wine within the goblet boil,\nCold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp'd shells,\nOn sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn\nThrough all their labyrinths; and let the maid\nBlush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris'd.\nChief isle of the embowered Cyclades,\nRejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,\nAnd poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech,\nIn which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,\nAnd hazels thick, dark-stemm'd beneath the shade:\nApollo is once more the golden theme!\nWhere was he, when the Giant of the sun\nStood bright, amid the sorrow of his peers?\nTogether had he left his mother fair\nAnd his twin-sister sleeping in their bower,\nAnd in the morning twilight wandered forth\nBeside the osiers of a rivulet,\nFull ankle-deep in lilies of the vale.\nThe nightingale had ceas'd, and a few stars\nWere lingering in the heavens, while the thrush\nBegan calm-throated.  Throughout all the isle\nThere was no covert, no retired cave,\nUnhaunted by the murmurous noise of waves,\nThough scarcely heard in many a green recess.\nHe listen'd, and he wept, and his bright tears\nWent trickling down the golden bow he held.\nThus with half-shut suffused eyes he stood,\nWhile from beneath some cumbrous boughs hard by\nWith solemn step an awful Goddess came,\nAnd there was purport in her looks for him,\nWhich he with eager guess began to read\nPerplex'd, the while melodiously he said:\n\"How cam'st thou over the unfooted sea?\nOr hath that antique mien and robed form\nMov'd in these vales invisible till now?\nSure I have heard those vestments sweeping o'er\nThe fallen leaves, when I have sat alone\nIn cool mid-forest.  Surely I have traced\nThe rustle of those ample skirts about\nThese grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers\nLift up their heads, as still the whisper pass'd.\nGoddess! I have beheld those eyes before,\nAnd their eternal calm, and all that face,\nOr I have dream'd.\"---\"Yes,\" said the supreme shape,\n\"Thou hast dream'd of me; and awaking up\nDidst find a lyre all golden by thy side,\nWhose strings touch'd by thy fingers, all the vast\nUnwearied ear of the whole universe\nListen'd in pain and pleasure at the birth\nOf such new tuneful wonder. Is't not strange\nThat thou shouldst weep, so gifted? Tell me, youth,\nWhat sorrow thou canst feel; for I am sad\nWhen thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs\nTo one who in this lonely isle hath been\nThe watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,\nFrom the young day when first thy infant hand\nPluck'd witless the weak flowers, till thine arm\nCould bend that bow heroic to all times.\nShow thy heart's secret to an ancient Power\nWho hath forsaken old and sacred thrones\nFor prophecies of thee, and for the sake\nOf loveliness new born.\"---Apollo then,\nWith sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes,\nThus answer'd, while his white melodious throat\nThrobb'd with the syllables.---\"Mnemosyne!\nThy name is on my tongue, I know not how;\nWhy should I tell thee what thou so well seest?\nWhy should I strive to show what from thy lips\nWould come no mystery? For me, dark, dark,\nAnd painful vile oblivion seals my eyes:\nI strive to search wherefore I am so sad,\nUntil a melancholy numbs my limbs;\nAnd then upon the grass I sit, and moan,\nLike one who once had wings.---O why should I\nFeel curs'd and thwarted, when the liegeless air\nYields to my step aspirant? why should I\nSpurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?\nGoddess benign, point forth some unknown thing:\nAre there not other regions than this isle?\nWhat are the stars? There is the sun, the sun!\nAnd the most patient brilliance of the moon!\nAnd stars by thousands!  Point me out the way\nTo any one particular beauteous star,\nAnd I will flit into it with my lyre,\nAnd make its silvery splendor pant with bliss.\nI have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?\nWhose hand, whose essence, what divinity\nMakes this alarum in the elements,\nWhile I here idle listen on the shores\nIn fearless yet in aching ignorance?\nO tell me, lonely Goddess, by thy harp,\nThat waileth every morn and eventide,\nTell me why thus I rave about these groves!\nMute thou remainest---Mute! yet I can read\nA wondrous lesson in thy silent face:\nKnowledge enormous makes a God of me.\nNames, deeds, gray legends, dire events, rebellions,\nMajesties, sovran voices, agonies,\nCreations and destroyings, all at once\nPour into the wide hollows of my brain,\nAnd deify me, as if some blithe wine\nOr bright elixir peerless I had drunk,\nAnd so become immortal.\"---Thus the God,\nWhile his enkindled eyes, with level glance\nBeneath his white soft temples, steadfast kept\nTrembling with light upon Mnemosyne.\nSoon wild commotions shook him, and made flush\nAll the immortal fairness of his limbs;\nMost like the struggle at the gate of death;\nOr liker still to one who should take leave\nOf pale immortal death, and with a pang\nAs hot as death's is chill, with fierce convulse\nDie into life: so young Apollo anguish'd:\nHis very hair, his golden tresses famed,\nKept undulation round his eager neck.\nDuring the pain Mnemosyne upheld\nHer arms as one who prophesied. At length\nApollo shriek'd;---and lo! from all his limbs\nCelestial."},{"title":"Endymion: Book II","author":"John Keats","text":"O Sovereign power of love! O grief! O balm!\nAll records, saving thine, come cool, and calm,\nAnd shadowy, through the mist of passed years:\nFor others, good or bad, hatred and tears\nHave become indolent; but touching thine,\nOne sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,\nOne kiss brings honey-dew from buried days.\nThe woes of Troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,\nStiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,\nStruggling, and blood, and shrieks--all dimly fades\nInto some backward corner of the brain;\nYet, in our very souls, we feel amain\nThe close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.\nHence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!\nSwart planet in the universe of deeds!\nWide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds\nAlong the pebbled shore of memory!\nMany old rotten-timber'd boats there be\nUpon thy vaporous bosom, magnified\nTo goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,\nAnd golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry.\nBut wherefore this? What care, though owl did fly\nAbout the great Athenian admiral's mast?\nWhat care, though striding Alexander past\nThe Indus with his Macedonian numbers?\nThough old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers\nThe glutted Cyclops, what care?--Juliet leaning\nAmid her window-flowers,--sighing,--weaning\nTenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,\nDoth more avail than these: the silver flow\nOf Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,\nFair Pastorella in the bandit's den,\nAre things to brood on with more ardency\nThan the death-day of empires. Fearfully\nMust such conviction come upon his head,\nWho, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,\nWithout one muse's smile, or kind behest,\nThe path of love and poesy. But rest,\nIn chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear\nThan to be crush'd, in striving to uprear\nLove's standard on the battlements of song.\nSo once more days and nights aid me along,\nLike legion'd soldiers.\n\n                        Brain-sick shepherd-prince,\nWhat promise hast thou faithful guarded since\nThe day of sacrifice? Or, have new sorrows\nCome with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?\nAlas! 'tis his old grief. For many days,\nHas he been wandering in uncertain ways:\nThrough wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;\nCounting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes\nOf the lone woodcutter; and listening still,\nHour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill.\nNow he is sitting by a shady spring,\nAnd elbow-deep with feverous fingering\nStems the upbursting cold: a wild rose tree\nPavilions him in bloom, and he doth see\nA bud which snares his fancy: lo! but now\nHe plucks it, dips its stalk in the water: how!\nIt swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;\nAnd, in the middle, there is softly pight\nA golden butterfly; upon whose wings\nThere must be surely character'd strange things,\nFor with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft.\n\n  Lightly this little herald flew aloft,\nFollow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands:\nOnward it flies. From languor's sullen bands\nHis limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies\nDazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.\nIt seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;\nAnd like a new-born spirit did he pass\nThrough the green evening quiet in the sun,\nO'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,\nThrough buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams\nThe summer time away. One track unseams\nA wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue\nOf ocean fades upon him; then, anew,\nHe sinks adown a solitary glen,\nWhere there was never sound of mortal men,\nSaving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences\nMelting to silence, when upon the breeze\nSome holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,\nTo cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet\nWent swift beneath the merry-winged guide,\nUntil it reached a splashing fountain's side\nThat, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd\nUnto the temperate air: then high it soar'd,\nAnd, downward, suddenly began to dip,\nAs if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip\nThe crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch\nMost delicate, as though afraid to smutch\nEven with mealy gold the waters clear.\nBut, at that very touch, to disappear\nSo fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,\nEndymion sought around, and shook each bed\nOf covert flowers in vain; and then he flung\nHimself along the grass. What gentle tongue,\nWhat whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?\nIt was a nymph uprisen to the breast\nIn the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood\n'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.\nTo him her dripping hand she softly kist,\nAnd anxiously began to plait and twist\nHer ringlets round her fingers, saying: \"Youth!\nToo long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,\nThe bitterness of love: too long indeed,\nSeeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed\nThy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer\nAll the bright riches of my crystal coffer\nTo Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,\nGolden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,\nVermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;\nYea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws\nA virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands\nTawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands\nBy my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,\nMy charming rod, my potent river spells;\nYes, every thing, even to the pearly cup\nMeander gave me,--for I bubbled up\nTo fainting creatures in a desert wild.\nBut woe is me, I am but as a child\nTo gladden thee; and all I dare to say,\nIs, that I pity thee; that on this day\nI've been thy guide; that thou must wander far\nIn other regions, past the scanty bar\nTo mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en\nFrom every wasting sigh, from every pain,\nInto the gentle bosom of thy love.\nWhy it is thus, one knows in heaven above:\nBut, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!\nI have a ditty for my hollow cell.\"\n\n  Hereat, she vanished from Endymion's gaze,\nWho brooded o'er the water in amaze:\nThe dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool\nLay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,\nQuick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,\nAnd fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill\nHad fallen out that hour. The wanderer,\nHolding his forehead, to keep off the burr\nOf smothering fancies, patiently sat down;\nAnd, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown\nGlow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,\nThus breath'd he to himself: \"Whoso encamps\nTo take a fancied city of delight,\nO what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,\nAfter long toil and travelling, to miss\nThe kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:\nYet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;\nAnother city doth he set about,\nFree from the smallest pebble-bead of doubt\nThat he will seize on trickling honey-combs:\nAlas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,\nAnd onward to another city speeds.\nBut this is human life: the war, the deeds,\nThe disappointment, the anxiety,\nImagination's struggles, far and nigh,\nAll human; bearing in themselves this good,\nThat they are sill the air, the subtle food,\nTo make us feel existence, and to shew\nHow quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,\nWhether to weeds or flowers; but for me,\nThere is no depth to strike in: I can see\nNought earthly worth my compassing; so stand\nUpon a misty, jutting head of land--\nAlone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,\nWhen mad Eurydice is listening to 't;\nI'd rather stand upon this misty peak,\nWith not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,\nBut the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,\nThan be--I care not what. O meekest dove\nOf heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!\nFrom thy blue throne, now filling all the air,\nGlance but one little beam of temper'd light\nInto my bosom, that the dreadful might\nAnd tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!\nYet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,\nWould give a pang to jealous misery,\nWorse than the torment's self: but rather tie\nLarge wings upon my shoulders, and point out\nMy love's far dwelling. Though the playful rout\nOf Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,\nToo keen in beauty, for thy silver prow\nNot to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream.\nO be propitious, nor severely deem\nMy madness impious; for, by all the stars\nThat tend thy bidding, I do think the bars\nThat kept my spirit in are burst--that I\nAm sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!\nHow beautiful thou art! The world how deep!\nHow tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep\nAround their axle! Then these gleaming reins,\nHow lithe! When this thy chariot attains\nIs airy goal, haply some bower veils\nThose twilight eyes? Those eyes!--my spirit fails--\nDear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air\nWill gulph me--help!\"--At this with madden'd stare,\nAnd lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;\nLike old Deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,\nOr blind Orion hungry for the morn.\nAnd, but from the deep cavern there was borne\nA voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;\nNor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan\nHad more been heard. Thus swell'd it forth: \"Descend,\nYoung mountaineer! descend where alleys bend\nInto the sparry hollows of the world!\nOft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd\nAs from thy threshold, day by day hast been\nA little lower than the chilly sheen\nOf icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms\nInto the deadening ether that still charms\nTheir marble being: now, as deep profound\nAs those are high, descend! He ne'er is crown'd\nWith immortality, who fears to follow\nWhere airy voices lead: so through the hollow,\nThe silent mysteries of earth, descend!\"\n\n  He heard but the last words, nor could contend\nOne moment in reflection: for he fled\nInto the fearful deep, to hide his head\nFrom the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness.\n\n  'Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;\nSharpening, by degrees, his appetite\nTo dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,\nThe region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,\nBut mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;\nA dusky empire and its diadems;\nOne faint eternal eventide of gems.\nAye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,\nAlong whose track the prince quick footsteps told,\nWith all its lines abrupt and angular:\nOut-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,\nThrough a vast antre; then the metal woof,\nLike Vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof\nCurves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,\nIt seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss\nFancy into belief: anon it leads\nThrough winding passages, where sameness breeds\nVexing conceptions of some sudden change;\nWhether to silver grots, or giant range\nOf sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge\nAthwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge\nNow fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath\nTowers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth\nA hundred waterfalls, whose voices come\nBut as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb\nHis bosom grew, when first he, far away,\nDescried an orbed diamond, set to fray\nOld darkness from his throne: 'twas like the sun\nUprisen o'er chaos: and with such a stun\nCame the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,\nHe saw not fiercer wonders--past the wit\nOf any spirit to tell, but one of those\nWho, when this planet's sphering time doth close,\nWill be its high remembrancers: who they?\nThe mighty ones who have made eternal day\nFor Greece and England. While astonishment\nWith deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went\nInto a marble gallery, passing through\nA mimic temple, so complete and true\nIn sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd\nTo search it inwards, whence far off appear'd,\nThrough a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,\nAnd, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,\nA quiver'd Dian. Stepping awfully,\nThe youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye\nDown sidelong aisles, and into niches old.\nAnd when, more near against the marble cold\nHe had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread\nAll courts and passages, where silence dead\nRous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:\nAnd long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint\nHimself with every mystery, and awe;\nTill, weary, he sat down before the maw\nOf a wide outlet, fathomless and dim\nTo wild uncertainty and shadows grim.\nThere, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,\nAnd thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore\nThe journey homeward to habitual self!\nA mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,\nWhose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,\nCheats us into a swamp, into a fire,\nInto the bosom of a hated thing.\n\n  What misery most drowningly doth sing\nIn lone Endymion's ear, now he has caught\nThe goal of consciousness? Ah, 'tis the thought,\nThe deadly feel of solitude: for lo!\nHe cannot see the heavens, nor the flow\nOf rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild\nIn pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,\nThe cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,\nLike herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest\nCool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;\nBut far from such companionship to wear\nAn unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,\nWas now his lot. And must he patient stay,\nTracing fantastic figures with his spear?\n\"No!\" exclaimed he, \"why should I tarry here?\"\nNo! loudly echoed times innumerable.\nAt which he straightway started, and 'gan tell\nHis paces back into the temple's chief;\nWarming and glowing strong in the belief\nOf help from Dian: so that when again\nHe caught her airy form, thus did he plain,\nMoving more near the while. \"O Haunter chaste\nOf river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,\nWhere with thy silver bow and arrows keen\nArt thou now forested? O woodland Queen,\nWhat smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?\nWhere dost thou listen to the wide halloos\nOf thy disparted nymphs? Through what dark tree\nGlimmers thy crescent? Wheresoe'er it be,\n'Tis in the breath of heaven: thou dost taste\nFreedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste\nThy loveliness in dismal elements;\nBut, finding in our green earth sweet contents,\nThere livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee\nIt feels Elysian, how rich to me,\nAn exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!\nWithin my breast there lives a choking flame--\nO let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!\nA homeward fever parches up my tongue--\nO let me slake it at the running springs!\nUpon my ear a noisy nothing rings--\nO let me once more hear the linnet's note!\nBefore mine eyes thick films and shadows float--\nO let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!\nDost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?\nO think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!\nDost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?\nO think how this dry palate would rejoice!\nIf in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,\nOh think how I should love a bed of flowers!--\nYoung goddess! let me see my native bowers!\nDeliver me from this rapacious deep!\"\n\n  Thus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap\nHis destiny, alert he stood: but when\nObstinate silence came heavily again,\nFeeling about for its old couch of space\nAnd airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face\nDesponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill.\nBut 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill\nTo its old channel, or a swollen tide\nTo margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,\nAnd flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns\nUp heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns\nItself, and strives its own delights to hide--\nNor in one spot alone; the floral pride\nIn a long whispering birth enchanted grew\nBefore his footsteps; as when heav'd anew\nOld ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,\nDown whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,\nBursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.\n\n  Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,\nUpon his fairy journey on he hastes;\nSo anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes\nOne moment with his hand among the sweets:\nOnward he goes--he stops--his bosom beats\nAs plainly in his ear, as the faint charm\nOf which the throbs were born. This still alarm,\nThis sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe:\nFor it came more softly than the east could blow\nArion's magic to the Atlantic isles;\nOr than the west, made jealous by the smiles\nOf thron'd Apollo, could breathe back the lyre\nTo seas Ionian and Tyrian.\n\n  O did he ever live, that lonely man,\nWho lov'd--and music slew not? 'Tis the pest\nOf love, that fairest joys give most unrest;\nThat things of delicate and tenderest worth\nAre swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,\nBy one consuming flame: it doth immerse\nAnd suffocate true blessings in a curse.\nHalf-happy, by comparison of bliss,\nIs miserable. 'Twas even so with this\nDew-dropping melody, in the Carian's ear;\nFirst heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,\nVanish'd in elemental passion.\n\n  And down some swart abysm he had gone,\nHad not a heavenly guide benignant led\nTo where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head\nBrushing, awakened: then the sounds again\nWent noiseless as a passing noontide rain\nOver a bower, where little space he stood;\nFor as the sunset peeps into a wood\nSo saw he panting light, and towards it went\nThrough winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!\nUpon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,\nCupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.\n\n  After a thousand mazes overgone,\nAt last, with sudden step, he came upon\nA chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,\nFull of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,\nAnd more of beautiful and strange beside:\nFor on a silken couch of rosy pride,\nIn midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth\nOf fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,\nThan sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:\nAnd coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,\nOr ripe October's faded marigolds,\nFell sleek about him in a thousand folds--\nNot hiding up an Apollonian curve\nOf neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve\nOf knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;\nBut rather, giving them to the filled sight\nOfficiously. Sideway his face repos'd\nOn one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,\nBy tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth\nTo slumbery pout; just as the morning south\nDisparts a dew-lipp'd rose. Above his head,\nFour lily stalks did their white honours wed\nTo make a coronal; and round him grew\nAll tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,\nTogether intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh:\nThe vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,\nShading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,\nOf velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;\nConvolvulus in streaked vases flush;\nThe creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;\nAnd virgin's bower, trailing airily;\nWith others of the sisterhood. Hard by,\nStood serene Cupids watching silently.\nOne, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,\nMuffling to death the pathos with his wings;\nAnd, ever and anon, uprose to look\nAt the youth's slumber; while another took\nA willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,\nAnd shook it on his hair; another flew\nIn through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise\nRain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes.\n\n  At these enchantments, and yet many more,\nThe breathless Latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;\nUntil, impatient in embarrassment,\nHe forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went\nTo that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,\nSmiling, thus whisper'd: \"Though from upper day\nThou art a wanderer, and thy presence here\nMight seem unholy, be of happy cheer!\nFor 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,\nWhen some ethereal and high-favouring donor\nPresents immortal bowers to mortal sense;\nAs now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence\nWas I in no wise startled. So recline\nUpon these living flowers. Here is wine,\nAlive with sparkles--never, I aver,\nSince Ariadne was a vintager,\nSo cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,\nSent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears\nWere high about Pomona: here is cream,\nDeepening to richness from a snowy gleam;\nSweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd\nFor the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd\nBy any touch, a bunch of blooming plums\nReady to melt between an infant's gums:\nAnd here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees,\nIn starlight, by the three Hesperides.\nFeast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know\nOf all these things around us.\" He did so,\nStill brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;\nAnd thus: \"I need not any hearing tire\nBy telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd\nFor a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind\nHim all in all unto her doting self.\nWho would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,\nHe was content to let her amorous plea\nFaint through his careless arms; content to see\nAn unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;\nContent, O fool! to make a cold retreat,\nWhen on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,\nLay sorrowing; when every tear was born\nOf diverse passion; when her lips and eyes\nWere clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs\nCame vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small.\nHush! no exclaim--yet, justly mightst thou call\nCurses upon his head.--I was half glad,\nBut my poor mistress went distract and mad,\nWhen the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew\nTo Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew\nImmortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;\nWhereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd\nEach summer time to life. Lo! this is he,\nThat same Adonis, safe in the privacy\nOf this still region all his winter-sleep.\nAye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep\nOver his waned corse, the tremulous shower\nHeal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,\nMedicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:\nThe which she fills with visions, and doth dress\nIn all this quiet luxury; and hath set\nUs young immortals, without any let,\nTo watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd,\nEven to a moment's filling up, and fast\nShe scuds with summer breezes, to pant through\nThe first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew\nEmbower'd sports in Cytherea's isle.\nLook! how those winged listeners all this while\nStand anxious: see! behold!\"--This clamant word\nBroke through the careful silence; for they heard\nA rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd\nPigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd,\nThe while one hand, that erst upon his thigh\nLay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually\nUp to his forehead. Then there was a hum\nOf sudden voices, echoing, \"Come! come!\nArise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd\nUnto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd\nFull soothingly to every nested finch:\nRise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch\nTo your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!\"\nAt this, from every side they hurried in,\nRubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,\nAnd doubling overhead their little fists\nIn backward yawns. But all were soon alive:\nFor as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive\nIn nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,\nSo from the arbour roof down swell'd an air\nOdorous and enlivening; making all\nTo laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call\nFor their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green\nDisparted, and far upward could be seen\nBlue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,\nWhose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,\nSpun off a drizzling dew,--which falling chill\nOn soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still\nNestle and turn uneasily about.\nSoon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,\nAnd silken traces lighten'd in descent;\nAnd soon, returning from love's banishment,\nQueen Venus leaning downward open arm'd:\nHer shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd\nA tumult to his heart, and a new life\nInto his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,\nBut for her comforting! unhappy sight,\nBut meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write\nOf these first minutes? The unchariest muse\nTo embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.\n\n  O it has ruffled every spirit there,\nSaving love's self, who stands superb to share\nThe general gladness: awfully he stands;\nA sovereign quell is in his waving hands;\nNo sight can bear the lightning of his bow;\nHis quiver is mysterious, none can know\nWhat themselves think of it; from forth his eyes\nThere darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:\nA scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who\nLook full upon it feel anon the blue\nOf his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.\nEndymion feels it, and no more controls\nThe burning prayer within him; so, bent low,\nHe had begun a plaining of his woe.\nBut Venus, bending forward, said: \"My child,\nFavour this gentle youth; his days are wild\nWith love--he--but alas! too well I see\nThou know'st the deepness of his misery.\nAh, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,\nThat when through heavy hours I used to rue\nThe endless sleep of this new-born Adon',\nThis stranger ay I pitied. For upon\nA dreary morning once I fled away\nInto the breezy clouds, to weep and pray\nFor this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz'd\nMe even to tears: thence, when a little eas'd,\nDown-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,\nI saw this youth as he despairing stood:\nThose same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind:\nThose same full fringed lids a constant blind\nOver his sullen eyes: I saw him throw\nHimself on wither'd leaves, even as though\nDeath had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,\nYet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd\nSome fair immortal, and that his embrace\nHad zoned her through the night. There is no trace\nOf this in heaven: I have mark'd each cheek,\nAnd find it is the vainest thing to seek;\nAnd that of all things 'tis kept secretest.\nEndymion! one day thou wilt be blest:\nSo still obey the guiding hand that fends\nThee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.\n'Tis a concealment needful in extreme;\nAnd if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam\nThou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!\nHere must we leave thee.\"--At these words up flew\nThe impatient doves, up rose the floating car,\nUp went the hum celestial. High afar\nThe Latmian saw them minish into nought;\nAnd, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught\nA vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.\nWhen all was darkened, with Etnean throe\nThe earth clos'd--gave a solitary moan--\nAnd left him once again in twilight lone.\n\n  He did not rave, he did not stare aghast,\nFor all those visions were o'ergone, and past,\nAnd he in loneliness: he felt assur'd\nOf happy times, when all he had endur'd\nWould seem a feather to the mighty prize.\nSo, with unusual gladness, on he hies\nThrough caves, and palaces of mottled ore,\nGold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,\nBlack polish'd porticos of awful shade,\nAnd, at the last, a diamond balustrade,\nLeading afar past wild magnificence,\nSpiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence\nStretching across a void, then guiding o'er\nEnormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,\nStreams subterranean tease their granite beds;\nThen heighten'd just above the silvery heads\nOf a thousand fountains, so that he could dash\nThe waters with his spear; but at the splash,\nDone heedlessly, those spouting columns rose\nSudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose\nHis diamond path with fretwork, streaming round\nAlive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,\nHaply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells\nWelcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells\nOn this delight; for, every minute's space,\nThe streams with changed magic interlace:\nSometimes like delicatest lattices,\nCover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,\nMoving about as in a gentle wind,\nWhich, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,\nPour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,\nSpangled, and rich with liquid broideries\nOf flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair.\nSwifter than lightning went these wonders rare;\nAnd then the water, into stubborn streams\nCollecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,\nPillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,\nOf those dusk places in times far aloof\nCathedrals call'd. He bade a loth farewel\nTo these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,\nAnd torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,\nHalf seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,\nBlackening on every side, and overhead\nA vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread\nWith starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,\nThe solitary felt a hurried change\nWorking within him into something dreary,--\nVex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,\nAnd purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.\nBut he revives at once: for who beholds\nNew sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?\nForth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,\nCame mother Cybele! alone--alone--\nIn sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown\nAbout her majesty, and front death-pale,\nWith turrets crown'd. Four maned lions hale\nThe sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,\nTheir surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws\nUplifted drowsily, and nervy tails\nCowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails\nThis shadowy queen athwart, and faints away\nIn another gloomy arch.\n\n                          Wherefore delay,\nYoung traveller, in such a mournful place?\nArt thou wayworn, or canst not further trace\nThe diamond path? And does it indeed end\nAbrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend\nThy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne\nCall ardently! He was indeed wayworn;\nAbrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;\nTo cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost\nTowards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,\nWithout one impious word, himself he flings,\nCommitted to the darkness and the gloom:\nDown, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,\nSwift as a fathoming plummet down he fell\nThrough unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,\nAnd rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,\nCame swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd\nSo thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd\nLarge honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd\nWith airs delicious. In the greenest nook\nThe eagle landed him, and farewel took.\n\n  It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown\nWith golden moss. His every sense had grown\nEthereal for pleasure; 'bove his head\nFlew a delight half-graspable; his tread\nWas Hesperean; to his capable ears\nSilence was music from the holy spheres;\nA dewy luxury was in his eyes;\nThe little flowers felt his pleasant sighs\nAnd stirr'd them faintly. Verdant cave and cell\nHe wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell\nOf sudden exaltation: but, \"Alas!\nSaid he, \"will all this gush of feeling pass\nAway in solitude? And must they wane,\nLike melodies upon a sandy plain,\nWithout an echo? Then shall I be left\nSo sad, so melancholy, so bereft!\nYet still I feel immortal! O my love,\nMy breath of life, where art thou? High above,\nDancing before the morning gates of heaven?\nOr keeping watch among those starry seven,\nOld Atlas' children? Art a maid of the waters,\nOne of shell-winding Triton's bright-hair'd daughters?\nOr art, impossible! a nymph of Dian's,\nWeaving a coronal of tender scions\nFor very idleness? Where'er thou art,\nMethinks it now is at my will to start\nInto thine arms; to scare Aurora's train,\nAnd snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main\nTo scud like a wild bird, and take thee off\nFrom thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff\nThy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves.\nNo, no, too eagerly my soul deceives\nIts powerless self: I know this cannot be.\nO let me then by some sweet dreaming flee\nTo her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!\nHither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil\nFor some few hours the coming solitude.\"\n\n  Thus spake he, and that moment felt endued\nWith power to dream deliciously; so wound\nThrough a dim passage, searching till he found\nThe smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where\nHe threw himself, and just into the air\nStretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!\nA naked waist: \"Fair Cupid, whence is this?\"\nA well-known voice sigh'd, \"Sweetest, here am I!\"\nAt which soft ravishment, with doating cry\nThey trembled to each other.--Helicon!\nO fountain'd hill! Old Homer's Helicon!\nThat thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er\nThese sorry pages; then the verse would soar\nAnd sing above this gentle pair, like lark\nOver his nested young: but all is dark\nAround thine aged top, and thy clear fount\nExhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count\nOf mighty Poets is made up; the scroll\nIs folded by the Muses; the bright roll\nIs in Apollo's hand: our dazed eyes\nHave seen a new tinge in the western skies:\nThe world has done its duty. Yet, oh yet,\nAlthough the sun of poesy is set,\nThese lovers did embrace, and we must weep\nThat there is no old power left to steep\nA quill immortal in their joyous tears.\nLong time in silence did their anxious fears\nQuestion that thus it was; long time they lay\nFondling and kissing every doubt away;\nLong time ere soft caressing sobs began\nTo mellow into words, and then there ran\nTwo bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.\n\"O known Unknown! from whom my being sips\nSuch darling essence, wherefore may I not\nBe ever in these arms? in this sweet spot\nPillow my chin for ever? ever press\nThese toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?\nWhy not for ever and for ever feel\nThat breath about my eyes? Ah, thou wilt steal\nAway from me again, indeed, indeed--\nThou wilt be gone away, and wilt not heed\nMy lonely madness. Speak, my kindest fair!\nIs--is it to be so? No! Who will dare\nTo pluck thee from me? And, of thine own will,\nFull well I feel thou wouldst not leave me. Still\nLet me entwine thee surer, surer--now\nHow can we part? Elysium! who art thou?\nWho, that thou canst not be for ever here,\nOr lift me with thee to some starry sphere?\nEnchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,\nBy the most soft completion of thy face,\nThose lips, O slippery blisses, twinkling eyes,\nAnd by these tenderest, milky sovereignties--\nThese tenderest, and by the nectar-wine,\nThe passion\"--------\"O lov'd Ida the divine!\nEndymion! dearest! Ah, unhappy me!\nHis soul will 'scape us--O felicity!\nHow he does love me! His poor temples beat\nTo the very tune of love--how sweet, sweet, sweet.\nRevive, dear youth, or I shall faint and die;\nRevive, or these soft hours will hurry by\nIn tranced dulness; speak, and let that spell\nAffright this lethargy! I cannot quell\nIts heavy pressure, and will press at least\nMy lips to thine, that they may richly feast\nUntil we taste the life of love again.\nWhat! dost thou move? dost kiss? O bliss! O pain!\nI love thee, youth, more than I can conceive;\nAnd so long absence from thee doth bereave\nMy soul of any rest: yet must I hence:\nYet, can I not to starry eminence\nUplift thee; nor for very shame can own\nMyself to thee. Ah, dearest, do not groan\nOr thou wilt force me from this secrecy,\nAnd I must blush in heaven. O that I\nHad done it already; that the dreadful smiles\nAt my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,\nHad waned from Olympus' solemn height,\nAnd from all serious Gods; that our delight\nWas quite forgotten, save of us alone!\nAnd wherefore so ashamed? 'Tis but to atone\nFor endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:\nYet must I be a coward!--Horror rushes\nToo palpable before me--the sad look\nOf Jove--Minerva's start--no bosom shook\nWith awe of purity--no Cupid pinion\nIn reverence veiled--my crystaline dominion\nHalf lost, and all old hymns made nullity!\nBut what is this to love? O I could fly\nWith thee into the ken of heavenly powers,\nSo thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,\nPress me so sweetly. Now I swear at once\nThat I am wise, that Pallas is a dunce--\nPerhaps her love like mine is but unknown--\nO I do think that I have been alone\nIn chastity: yes, Pallas has been sighing,\nWhile every eve saw me my hair uptying\nWith fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,\nI was as vague as solitary dove,\nNor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss--\nAye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,\nAn immortality of passion's thine:\nEre long I will exalt thee to the shine\nOf heaven ambrosial; and we will shade\nOurselves whole summers by a river glade;\nAnd I will tell thee stories of the sky,\nAnd breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy.\nMy happy love will overwing all bounds!\nO let me melt into thee; let the sounds\nOf our close voices marry at their birth;\nLet us entwine hoveringly--O dearth\nOf human words! roughness of mortal speech!\nLispings empyrean will I sometime teach\nThine honied tongue--lute-breathings, which I gasp\nTo have thee understand, now while I clasp\nThee thus, and weep for fondness--I am pain'd,\nEndymion: woe! woe! is grief contain'd\nIn the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?\"--\nHereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife\nMelted into a languor. He return'd\nEntranced vows and tears.\n\n                          Ye who have yearn'd\nWith too much passion, will here stay and pity,\nFor the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty\nNot of these days, but long ago 'twas told\nBy a cavern wind unto a forest old;\nAnd then the forest told it in a dream\nTo a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam\nA poet caught as he was journeying\nTo Phoebus' shrine; and in it he did fling\nHis weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,\nAnd after, straight in that inspired place\nHe sang the story up into the air,\nGiving it universal freedom. There\nHas it been ever sounding for those ears\nWhose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers\nYon centinel stars; and he who listens to it\nMust surely be self-doomed or he will rue it:\nFor quenchless burnings come upon the heart,\nMade fiercer by a fear lest any part\nShould be engulphed in the eddying wind.\nAs much as here is penn'd doth always find\nA resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;\nAnon the strange voice is upon the wane--\nAnd 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,\nThat the fair visitant at last unwound\nHer gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep.--\nThus the tradition of the gusty deep.\n\n  Now turn we to our former chroniclers.--\nEndymion awoke, that grief of hers\nSweet paining on his ear: he sickly guess'd\nHow lone he was once more, and sadly press'd\nHis empty arms together, hung his head,\nAnd most forlorn upon that widow'd bed\nSat silently. Love's madness he had known:\nOften with more than tortured lion's groan\nMoanings had burst from him; but now that rage\nHad pass'd away: no longer did he wage\nA rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars.\nNo, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:\nThe lyre of his soul Eolian tun'd\nForgot all violence, and but commun'd\nWith melancholy thought: O he had swoon'd\nDrunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love\nHenceforth was dove-like.--Loth was he to move\nFrom the imprinted couch, and when he did,\n'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid\nIn muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd\nHalf seeing visions that might have dismay'd\nAlecto's serpents; ravishments more keen\nThan Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean\nOver eclipsing eyes: and at the last\nIt was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,\nO'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,\nAnd crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,\nOf every shape and size, even to the bulk\nIn which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk\nAgainst an endless storm. Moreover too,\nFish-semblances, of green and azure hue,\nReady to snort their streams. In this cool wonder\nEndymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder\nOn all his life: his youth, up to the day\nWhen 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,\nHe stept upon his shepherd throne: the look\nOf his white palace in wild forest nook,\nAnd all the revels he had lorded there:\nEach tender maiden whom he once thought fair,\nWith every friend and fellow-woodlander--\nPass'd like a dream before him. Then the spur\nOf the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans\nTo nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans:\nThat wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:\nHis sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,\nUntil into the earth's deep maw he rush'd:\nThen all its buried magic, till it flush'd\nHigh with excessive love. \"And now,\" thought he,\n\"How long must I remain in jeopardy\nOf blank amazements that amaze no more?\nNow I have tasted her sweet soul to the core\nAll other depths are shallow: essences,\nOnce spiritual, are like muddy lees,\nMeant but to fertilize my earthly root,\nAnd make my branches lift a golden fruit\nInto the bloom of heaven: other light,\nThough it be quick and sharp enough to blight\nThe Olympian eagle's vision, is dark,\nDark as the parentage of chaos. Hark!\nMy silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;\nOr they are but the ghosts, the dying swells\nOf noises far away?--list!\"--Hereupon\nHe kept an anxious ear. The humming tone\nCame louder, and behold, there as he lay,\nOn either side outgush'd, with misty spray,\nA copious spring; and both together dash'd\nSwift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd\nAmong the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,\nLeaving a trickling dew. At last they shot\nDown from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise\nAs of some breathless racers whose hopes poize\nUpon the last few steps, and with spent force\nAlong the ground they took a winding course.\nEndymion follow'd--for it seem'd that one\nEver pursued, the other strove to shun--\nFollow'd their languid mazes, till well nigh\nHe had left thinking of the mystery,--\nAnd was now rapt in tender hoverings\nOver the vanish'd bliss. Ah! what is it sings\nHis dream away? What melodies are these?\nThey sound as through the whispering of trees,\nNot native in such barren vaults. Give ear!\n\n  \"O Arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear\nSuch tenderness as mine? Great Dian, why,\nWhy didst thou hear her prayer? O that I\nWere rippling round her dainty fairness now,\nCircling about her waist, and striving how\nTo entice her to a dive! then stealing in\nBetween her luscious lips and eyelids thin.\nO that her shining hair was in the sun,\nAnd I distilling from it thence to run\nIn amorous rillets down her shrinking form!\nTo linger on her lily shoulders, warm\nBetween her kissing breasts, and every charm\nTouch raptur'd!--See how painfully I flow:\nFair maid, be pitiful to my great woe.\nStay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,\nA happy wooer, to the flowery mead\nWhere all that beauty snar'd me.\"--\"Cruel god,\nDesist! or my offended mistress' nod\nWill stagnate all thy fountains:--tease me not\nWith syren words--Ah, have I really got\nSuch power to madden thee? And is it true--\nAway, away, or I shall dearly rue\nMy very thoughts: in mercy then away,\nKindest Alpheus for should I obey\nMy own dear will, 'twould be a deadly bane.\"--\n\"O, Oread-Queen! would that thou hadst a pain\nLike this of mine, then would I fearless turn\nAnd be a criminal.\"--\"Alas, I burn,\nI shudder--gentle river, get thee hence.\nAlpheus! thou enchanter! every sense\nOf mine was once made perfect in these woods.\nFresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,\nRipe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;\nBut ever since I heedlessly did lave\nIn thy deceitful stream, a panting glow\nGrew strong within me: wherefore serve me so,\nAnd call it love? Alas, 'twas cruelty.\nNot once more did I close my happy eyes\nAmid the thrush's song. Away! Avaunt!\nO 'twas a cruel thing.\"--\"Now thou dost taunt\nSo softly, Arethusa, that I think\nIf thou wast playing on my shady brink,\nThou wouldst bathe once again. Innocent maid!\nStifle thine heart no more;--nor be afraid\nOf angry powers: there are deities\nWill shade us with their wings. Those fitful sighs\n'Tis almost death to hear: O let me pour\nA dewy balm upon them!--fear no more,\nSweet Arethusa! Dian's self must feel\nSometimes these very pangs. Dear maiden, steal\nBlushing into my soul, and let us fly\nThese dreary caverns for the open sky.\nI will delight thee all my winding course,\nFrom the green sea up to my hidden source\nAbout Arcadian forests; and will shew\nThe channels where my coolest waters flow\nThrough mossy rocks; where, 'mid exuberant green,\nI roam in pleasant darkness, more unseen\nThan Saturn in his exile; where I brim\nRound flowery islands, and take thence a skim\nOf mealy sweets, which myriads of bees\nBuzz from their honied wings: and thou shouldst please\nThyself to choose the richest, where we might\nBe incense-pillow'd every summer night.\nDoff all sad fears, thou white deliciousness,\nAnd let us be thus comforted; unless\nThou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream\nHurry distracted from Sol's temperate beam,\nAnd pour to death along some hungry sands.\"--\n\"What can I do, Alpheus? Dian stands\nSevere before me: persecuting fate!\nUnhappy Arethusa! thou wast late\nA huntress free in\"--At this, sudden fell\nThose two sad streams adown a fearful dell.\nThe Latmian listen'd, but he heard no more,\nSave echo, faint repeating o'er and o'er\nThe name of Arethusa. On the verge\nOf that dark gulph he wept, and said: \"I urge\nThee, gentle Goddess of my pilgrimage,\nBy our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,\nIf thou art powerful, these lovers pains;\nAnd make them happy in some happy plains.\n\n  He turn'd--there was a whelming sound--he stept,\nThere was a cooler light; and so he kept\nTowards it by a sandy path, and lo!\nMore suddenly than doth a moment go,\nThe visions of the earth were gone and fled--\nHe saw the giant sea above his head."},{"title":"Endymion: Book III","author":"John Keats","text":"There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men\nWith most prevailing tinsel: who unpen\nTheir baaing vanities, to browse away\nThe comfortable green and juicy hay\nFrom human pastures; or, O torturing fact!\nWho, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd\nFire-branded foxes to sear up and singe\nOur gold and ripe-ear'd hopes. With not one tinge\nOf sanctuary splendour, not a sight\nAble to face an owl's, they still are dight\nBy the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,\nAnd crowns, and turbans.

Wherever beauty dwells,\nIn gulf or aerie, mountains or deep dells,\nIn light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,\nThou pointest out the way, and straight 'tis won.\nAmid his toil thou gav'st Leander breath;\nThou leddest Orpheus through the gleams of death;\nThou madest Pluto bear thin element;\nAnd now, O winged Chieftain! thou hast sent\nA moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,\nTo find Endymion.\n\n                  On gold sand impearl'd\nWith lily shells, and pebbles milky white,\nPoor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light\nAgainst his pallid face: he felt the charm\nTo breathlessness, and suddenly a warm\nOf his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd\nHis wandering steps, and half-entranced laid\nHis head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,\nTo taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,\nLashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.\nAnd so he kept, until the rosy veils\nMantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand\nWere lifted from the water's breast, and fann'd\nInto sweet air; and sober'd morning came\nMeekly through billows:--when like taper-flame\nLeft sudden by a dallying breath of air,\nHe rose in silence, and once more 'gan fare\nAlong his fated way.\n\n                      Far had he roam'd,\nWith nothing save the hollow vast, that foam'd\nAbove, around, and at his feet; save things\nMore dead than Morpheus' imaginings:\nOld rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large\nOf gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;\nRudders that for a hundred years had lost\nThe sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd\nWith long-forgotten story, and wherein\nNo reveller had ever dipp'd a chin\nBut those of Saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,\nWrit in the tongue of heaven, by those souls\nWho first were on the earth; and sculptures rude\nIn ponderous stone, developing the mood\nOf ancient Nox;--then skeletons of man,\nOf beast, behemoth, and leviathan,\nAnd elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw\nOf nameless monster. A cold leaden awe\nThese secrets struck into him; and unless\nDian had chaced away that heaviness,\nHe might have died: but now, with cheered feel,\nHe onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal\nAbout the labyrinth in his soul of love.\n\n  \"What is there in thee, Moon! that thou shouldst move\nMy heart so potently? When yet a child\nI oft have dried my tears when thou hast smil'd.\nThou seem'dst my sister: hand in hand we went\nFrom eve to morn across the firmament.\nNo apples would I gather from the tree,\nTill thou hadst cool'd their cheeks deliciously:\nNo tumbling water ever spake romance,\nBut when my eyes with thine thereon could dance:\nNo woods were green enough, no bower divine,\nUntil thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine:\nIn sowing time ne'er would I dibble take,\nOr drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;\nAnd, in the summer tide of blossoming,\nNo one but thee hath heard me blithly sing\nAnd mesh my dewy flowers all the night.\nNo melody was like a passing spright\nIf it went not to solemnize thy reign.\nYes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain\nBy thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;\nAnd as I grew in years, still didst thou blend\nWith all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;\nThou wast the mountain-top--the sage's pen--\nThe poet's harp--the voice of friends--the sun;\nThou wast the river--thou wast glory won;\nThou wast my clarion's blast--thou wast my steed--\nMy goblet full of wine--my topmost deed:--\nThou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!\nO what a wild and harmonized tune\nMy spirit struck from all the beautiful!\nOn some bright essence could I lean, and lull\nMyself to immortality: I prest\nNature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.\nBut, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss--\nMy strange love came--Felicity's abyss!\nShe came, and thou didst fade, and fade away--\nYet not entirely; no, thy starry sway\nHas been an under-passion to this hour.\nNow I begin to feel thine orby power\nIs coming fresh upon me: O be kind,\nKeep back thine influence, and do not blind\nMy sovereign vision.--Dearest love, forgive\nThat I can think away from thee and live!--\nPardon me, airy planet, that I prize\nOne thought beyond thine argent luxuries!\nHow far beyond!\" At this a surpris'd start\nFrosted the springing verdure of his heart;\nFor as he lifted up his eyes to swear\nHow his own goddess was past all things fair,\nHe saw far in the concave green of the sea\nAn old man sitting calm and peacefully.\nUpon a weeded rock this old man sat,\nAnd his white hair was awful, and a mat\nOf weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;\nAnd, ample as the largest winding-sheet,\nA cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,\nO'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans\nOf ambitious magic: every ocean-form\nWas woven in with black distinctness; storm,\nAnd calm, and whispering, and hideous roar\nWere emblem'd in the woof; with every shape\nThat skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape.\nThe gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,\nYet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell\nTo its huge self; and the minutest fish\nWould pass the very hardest gazer's wish,\nAnd show his little eye's anatomy.\nThen there was pictur'd the regality\nOf Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,\nIn beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.\nBeside this old man lay a pearly wand,\nAnd in his lap a book, the which he conn'd\nSo stedfastly, that the new denizen\nHad time to keep him in amazed ken,\nTo mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.\n\n  The old man rais'd his hoary head and saw\nThe wilder'd stranger--seeming not to see,\nHis features were so lifeless. Suddenly\nHe woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows\nWent arching up, and like two magic ploughs\nFurrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,\nWhich kept as fixedly as rocky marge,\nTill round his wither'd lips had gone a smile.\nThen up he rose, like one whose tedious toil\nHad watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,\nWho had not from mid-life to utmost age\nEas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,\nEven to the trees. He rose: he grasp'd his stole,\nWith convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,\nAnd in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd\nEcho into oblivion, he said:--\n\n  \"Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head\nIn peace upon my watery pillow: now\nSleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.\nO Jove! I shall be young again, be young!\nO shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc'd and stung\nWith new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,\nWhen I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?--\nI'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen\nTheir melodies, and see their long hair glisten;\nAnon upon that giant's arm I'll be,\nThat writhes about the roots of Sicily:\nTo northern seas I'll in a twinkling sail,\nAnd mount upon the snortings of a whale\nTo some black cloud; thence down I'll madly sweep\nOn forked lightning, to the deepest deep,\nWhere through some sucking pool I will be hurl'd\nWith rapture to the other side of the world!\nO, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,\nI bow full hearted to your old decree!\nYes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,\nFor I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.\nThou art the man!\" Endymion started back\nDismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack\nTortures hot breath, and speech of agony,\nMutter'd: \"What lonely death am I to die\nIn this cold region? Will he let me freeze,\nAnd float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?\nOr will he touch me with his searing hand,\nAnd leave a black memorial on the sand?\nOr tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,\nAnd keep me as a chosen food to draw\nHis magian fish through hated fire and flame?\nO misery of hell! resistless, tame,\nAm I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,\nUntil the gods through heaven's blue look out!--\nO Tartarus! but some few days agone\nHer soft arms were entwining me, and on\nHer voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:\nHer lips were all my own, and--ah, ripe sheaves\nOf happiness! ye on the stubble droop,\nBut never may be garner'd. I must stoop\nMy head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!\nIs there no hope from thee? This horrid spell\nWould melt at thy sweet breath.--By Dian's hind\nFeeding from her white fingers, on the wind\nI see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,\nI care not for this old mysterious man!\"\n\n  He spake, and walking to that aged form,\nLook'd high defiance. Lo! his heart 'gan warm\nWith pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept.\nHad he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?\nHad he, though blindly contumelious, brought\nRheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,\nConvulsion to a mouth of many years?\nHe had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.\nThe penitent shower fell, as down he knelt\nBefore that care-worn sage, who trembling felt\nAbout his large dark locks, and faultering spake:\n\n  \"Arise, good youth, for sacred Phoebus' sake!\nI know thine inmost bosom, and I feel\nA very brother's yearning for thee steal\nInto mine own: for why? thou openest\nThe prison gates that have so long opprest\nMy weary watching. Though thou know'st it not,\nThou art commission'd to this fated spot\nFor great enfranchisement. O weep no more;\nI am a friend to love, to loves of yore:\nAye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power\nI had been grieving at this joyous hour\nBut even now most miserable old,\nI saw thee, and my blood no longer cold\nGave mighty pulses: in this tottering case\nGrew a new heart, which at this moment plays\nAs dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,\nFor thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,\nNow as we speed towards our joyous task.\"\n\n  So saying, this young soul in age's mask\nWent forward with the Carian side by side:\nResuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide\nHung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands\nTook silently their foot-prints. \"My soul stands\nNow past the midway from mortality,\nAnd so I can prepare without a sigh\nTo tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.\nI was a fisher once, upon this main,\nAnd my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;\nRough billows were my home by night and day,--\nThe sea-gulls not more constant; for I had\nNo housing from the storm and tempests mad,\nBut hollow rocks,--and they were palaces\nOf silent happiness, of slumberous ease:\nLong years of misery have told me so.\nAye, thus it was one thousand years ago.\nOne thousand years!--Is it then possible\nTo look so plainly through them? to dispel\nA thousand years with backward glance sublime?\nTo breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime\nFrom off a crystal pool, to see its deep,\nAnd one's own image from the bottom peep?\nYes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,\nMy long captivity and moanings all\nAre but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,\nThe which I breathe away, and thronging come\nLike things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.\n\n  \"I touch'd no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:\nI was a lonely youth on desert shores.\nMy sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,\nAnd craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry\nPlaining discrepant between sea and sky.\nDolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen\nWould let me feel their scales of gold and green,\nNor be my desolation; and, full oft,\nWhen a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft\nIts hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe\nTo burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe\nMy life away like a vast sponge of fate,\nSome friendly monster, pitying my sad state,\nHas dived to its foundations, gulph'd it down,\nAnd left me tossing safely. But the crown\nOf all my life was utmost quietude:\nMore did I love to lie in cavern rude,\nKeeping in wait whole days for Neptune's voice,\nAnd if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!\nThere blush'd no summer eve but I would steer\nMy skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear\nThe shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,\nMingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep:\nAnd never was a day of summer shine,\nBut I beheld its birth upon the brine:\nFor I would watch all night to see unfold\nHeaven's gates, and Aethon snort his morning gold\nWide o'er the swelling streams: and constantly\nAt brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,\nMy nets would be spread out, and I at rest.\nThe poor folk of the sea-country I blest\nWith daily boon of fish most delicate:\nThey knew not whence this bounty, and elate\nWould strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.\n\n  \"Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach\nAt things which, but for thee, O Latmian!\nHad been my dreary death? Fool! I began\nTo feel distemper'd longings: to desire\nThe utmost privilege that ocean's sire\nCould grant in benediction: to be free\nOf all his kingdom. Long in misery\nI wasted, ere in one extremest fit\nI plung'd for life or death. To interknit\nOne's senses with so dense a breathing stuff\nMight seem a work of pain; so not enough\nCan I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,\nAnd buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt\nWhole days and days in sheer astonishment;\nForgetful utterly of self-intent;\nMoving but with the mighty ebb and flow.\nThen, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew\nHis spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,\nI tried in fear the pinions of my will.\n'Twas freedom! and at once I visited\nThe ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.\nNo need to tell thee of them, for I see\nThat thou hast been a witness--it must be\nFor these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,\nBy the melancholy corners of that mouth.\nSo I will in my story straightway pass\nTo more immediate matter. Woe, alas!\nThat love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!\nWhy did poor Glaucus ever--ever dare\nTo sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger-youth!\nI lov'd her to the very white of truth,\nAnd she would not conceive it. Timid thing!\nShe fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,\nRound every isle, and point, and promontory,\nFrom where large Hercules wound up his story\nFar as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew\nThe more, the more I saw her dainty hue\nGleam delicately through the azure clear:\nUntil 'twas too fierce agony to bear;\nAnd in that agony, across my grief\nIt flash'd, that Circe might find some relief--\nCruel enchantress! So above the water\nI rear'd my head, and look'd for Phoebus' daughter.\nAeaea's isle was wondering at the moon:--\nIt seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon\nLeft me dead-drifting to that fatal power.\n\n  \"When I awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;\nJust when the light of morn, with hum of bees,\nStole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.\nHow sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,\nAnd over it a sighing voice expire.\nIt ceased--I caught light footsteps; and anon\nThe fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon\nPush'd through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!\nWith tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove\nA net whose thraldom was more bliss than all\nThe range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall\nThe dew of her rich speech: \"Ah! Art awake?\nO let me hear thee speak, for Cupid's sake!\nI am so oppress'd with joy! Why, I have shed\nAn urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;\nAnd now I find thee living, I will pour\nFrom these devoted eyes their silver store,\nUntil exhausted of the latest drop,\nSo it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop\nHere, that I too may live: but if beyond\nSuch cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond\nOf soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;\nIf thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;\nIf smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,\nHang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,\nO let me pluck it for thee.\" Thus she link'd\nHer charming syllables, till indistinct\nTheir music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;\nAnd then she hover'd over me, and stole\nSo near, that if no nearer it had been\nThis furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen.\n\n  \"Young man of Latmos! thus particular\nAm I, that thou may'st plainly see how far\nThis fierce temptation went: and thou may'st not\nExclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?\n\n  \"Who could resist? Who in this universe?\nShe did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse\nMy fine existence in a golden clime.\nShe took me like a child of suckling time,\nAnd cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,\nThe current of my former life was stemm'd,\nAnd to this arbitrary queen of sense\nI bow'd a tranced vassal: nor would thence\nHave mov'd, even though Amphion's harp had woo'd\nMe back to Scylla o'er the billows rude.\nFor as Apollo each eve doth devise\nA new appareling for western skies;\nSo every eve, nay every spendthrift hour\nShed balmy consciousness within that bower.\nAnd I was free of haunts umbrageous;\nCould wander in the mazy forest-house\nOf squirrels, foxes shy, and antler'd deer,\nAnd birds from coverts innermost and drear\nWarbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow--\nTo me new born delights!\n\n                          \"Now let me borrow,\nFor moments few, a temperament as stern\nAs Pluto's sceptre, that my words not burn\nThese uttering lips, while I in calm speech tell\nHow specious heaven was changed to real hell.\n\n  \"One morn she left me sleeping: half awake\nI sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake\nMy greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;\nBut she was gone. Whereat the barbed shafts\nOf disappointment stuck in me so sore,\nThat out I ran and search'd the forest o'er.\nWandering about in pine and cedar gloom\nDamp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom\nA sound of moan, an agony of sound,\nSepulchral from the distance all around.\nThen came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled\nThat fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled\nDown a precipitous path, as if impell'd.\nI came to a dark valley.--Groanings swell'd\nPoisonous about my ears, and louder grew,\nThe nearer I approach'd a flame's gaunt blue,\nThat glar'd before me through a thorny brake.\nThis fire, like the eye of gordian snake,\nBewitch'd me towards; and I soon was near\nA sight too fearful for the feel of fear:\nIn thicket hid I curs'd the haggard scene--\nThe banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,\nSeated upon an uptorn forest root;\nAnd all around her shapes, wizard and brute,\nLaughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,\nShewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!\nO such deformities! Old Charon's self,\nShould he give up awhile his penny pelf,\nAnd take a dream 'mong rushes Stygian,\nIt could not be so phantasied. Fierce, wan,\nAnd tyrannizing was the lady's look,\nAs over them a gnarled staff she shook.\nOft-times upon the sudden she laugh'd out,\nAnd from a basket emptied to the rout\nClusters of grapes, the which they raven'd quick\nAnd roar'd for more; with many a hungry lick\nAbout their shaggy jaws. Avenging, slow,\nAnon she took a branch of mistletoe,\nAnd emptied on't a black dull-gurgling phial:\nGroan'd one and all, as if some piercing trial\nWas sharpening for their pitiable bones.\nShe lifted up the charm: appealing groans\nFrom their poor breasts went sueing to her ear\nIn vain; remorseless as an infant's bier\nShe whisk'd against their eyes the sooty oil.\nWhereat was heard a noise of painful toil,\nIncreasing gradual to a tempest rage,\nShrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;\nUntil their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat\nAnd puff from the tail's end to stifled throat:\nThen was appalling silence: then a sight\nMore wildering than all that hoarse affright;\nFor the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,\nWent through the dismal air like one huge Python\nAntagonizing Boreas,--and so vanish'd.\nYet there was not a breath of wind: she banish'd\nThese phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark\nCame waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,\nWith dancing and loud revelry,--and went\nSwifter than centaurs after rapine bent.--\nSighing an elephant appear'd and bow'd\nBefore the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud\nIn human accent: \"Potent goddess! chief\nOf pains resistless! make my being brief,\nOr let me from this heavy prison fly:\nOr give me to the air, or let me die!\nI sue not for my happy crown again;\nI sue not for my phalanx on the plain;\nI sue not for my lone, my widow'd wife;\nI sue not for my ruddy drops of life,\nMy children fair, my lovely girls and boys!\nI will forget them; I will pass these joys;\nAsk nought so heavenward, so too--too high:\nOnly I pray, as fairest boon, to die,\nOr be deliver'd from this cumbrous flesh,\nFrom this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,\nAnd merely given to the cold bleak air.\nHave mercy, Goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!\"\n\n  That curst magician's name fell icy numb\nUpon my wild conjecturing: truth had come\nNaked and sabre-like against my heart.\nI saw a fury whetting a death-dart;\nAnd my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,\nFainted away in that dark lair of night.\nThink, my deliverer, how desolate\nMy waking must have been! disgust, and hate,\nAnd terrors manifold divided me\nA spoil amongst them. I prepar'd to flee\nInto the dungeon core of that wild wood:\nI fled three days--when lo! before me stood\nGlaring the angry witch. O Dis, even now,\nA clammy dew is beading on my brow,\nAt mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse.\n\"Ha! ha! Sir Dainty! there must be a nurse\nMade of rose leaves and thistledown, express,\nTo cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee: yes,\nI am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:\nMy tenderest squeeze is but a giant's clutch.\nSo, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies\nUnheard of yet; and it shall still its cries\nUpon some breast more lily-feminine.\nOh, no--it shall not pine, and pine, and pine\nMore than one pretty, trifling thousand years;\nAnd then 'twere pity, but fate's gentle shears\nCut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!\nYoung dove of the waters! truly I'll not hurt\nOne hair of thine: see how I weep and sigh,\nThat our heart-broken parting is so nigh.\nAnd must we part? Ah, yes, it must be so.\nYet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,\nLet me sob over thee my last adieus,\nAnd speak a blessing: Mark me! thou hast thews\nImmortal, for thou art of heavenly race:\nBut such a love is mine, that here I chase\nEternally away from thee all bloom\nOf youth, and destine thee towards a tomb.\nHence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;\nAnd there, ere many days be overpast,\nDisabled age shall seize thee; and even then\nThou shalt not go the way of aged men;\nBut live and wither, cripple and still breathe\nTen hundred years: which gone, I then bequeath\nThy fragile bones to unknown burial.\nAdieu, sweet love, adieu!\"--As shot stars fall,\nShe fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung\nAnd poisoned was my spirit: despair sung\nA war-song of defiance 'gainst all hell.\nA hand was at my shoulder to compel\nMy sullen steps; another 'fore my eyes\nMoved on with pointed finger. In this guise\nEnforced, at the last by ocean's foam\nI found me; by my fresh, my native home.\nIts tempering coolness, to my life akin,\nCame salutary as I waded in;\nAnd, with a blind voluptuous rage, I gave\nBattle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave\nLarge froth before me, while there yet remain'd\nHale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain'd.\n\n  \"Young lover, I must weep--such hellish spite\nWith dry cheek who can tell? While thus my might\nProving upon this element, dismay'd,\nUpon a dead thing's face my hand I laid;\nI look'd--'twas Scylla! Cursed, cursed Circe!\nO vulture-witch, hast never heard of mercy?\nCould not thy harshest vengeance be content,\nBut thou must nip this tender innocent\nBecause I lov'd her?--Cold, O cold indeed\nWere her fair limbs, and like a common weed\nThe sea-swell took her hair. Dead as she was\nI clung about her waist, nor ceas'd to pass\nFleet as an arrow through unfathom'd brine,\nUntil there shone a fabric crystalline,\nRibb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl.\nHeadlong I darted; at one eager swirl\nGain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!\n'Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;\nAnd all around--But wherefore this to thee\nWho in few minutes more thyself shalt see?--\nI left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.\nMy fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread\nMet palsy half way: soon these limbs became\nGaunt, wither'd, sapless, feeble, cramp'd, and lame.\n\n  \"Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,\nWithout one hope, without one faintest trace\nOf mitigation, or redeeming bubble\nOf colour'd phantasy; for I fear 'twould trouble\nThy brain to loss of reason: and next tell\nHow a restoring chance came down to quell\nOne half of the witch in me.                 On a day,\nSitting upon a rock above the spray,\nI saw grow up from the horizon's brink\nA gallant vessel: soon she seem'd to sink\nAway from me again, as though her course\nHad been resum'd in spite of hindering force--\nSo vanish'd: and not long, before arose\nDark clouds, and muttering of winds morose.\nOld Eolus would stifle his mad spleen,\nBut could not: therefore all the billows green\nToss'd up the silver spume against the clouds.\nThe tempest came: I saw that vessel's shrouds\nIn perilous bustle; while upon the deck\nStood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;\nThe final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:\nI heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.\nO they had all been sav'd but crazed eld\nAnnull'd my vigorous cravings: and thus quell'd\nAnd curb'd, think on't, O Latmian! did I sit\nWrithing with pity, and a cursing fit\nAgainst that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,\nBy one and one, to pale oblivion;\nAnd I was gazing on the surges prone,\nWith many a scalding tear and many a groan,\nWhen at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,\nGrasping this scroll, and this same slender wand.\nI knelt with pain--reached out my hand--had grasp'd\nThese treasures--touch'd the knuckles--they unclasp'd--\nI caught a finger: but the downward weight\nO'erpowered me--it sank. Then 'gan abate\nThe storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst\nThe comfortable sun. I was athirst\nTo search the book, and in the warming air\nParted its dripping leaves with eager care.\nStrange matters did it treat of, and drew on\nMy soul page after page, till well-nigh won\nInto forgetfulness; when, stupefied,\nI read these words, and read again, and tried\nMy eyes against the heavens, and read again.\nO what a load of misery and pain\nEach Atlas-line bore off!--a shine of hope\nCame gold around me, cheering me to cope\nStrenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!\nFor thou hast brought their promise to an end.\n\n  \"In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,\nDoom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch\nHis loath'd existence through ten centuries,\nAnd then to die alone. Who can devise\nA total opposition? No one. So\nOne million times ocean must ebb and flow,\nAnd he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,\nThese things accomplish'd:--If he utterly\nScans all the depths of magic, and expounds\nThe meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;\nIf he explores all forms and substances\nStraight homeward to their symbol-essences;\nHe shall not die. Moreover, and in chief,\nHe must pursue this task of joy and grief\nMost piously;--all lovers tempest-tost,\nAnd in the savage overwhelming lost,\nHe shall deposit side by side, until\nTime's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:\nWhich done, and all these labours ripened,\nA youth, by heavenly power lov'd and led,\nShall stand before him; whom he shall direct\nHow to consummate all. The youth elect\nMust do the thing, or both will be destroy'd.\"--\n\n  \"Then,\" cried the young Endymion, overjoy'd,\n\"We are twin brothers in this destiny!\nSay, I intreat thee, what achievement high\nIs, in this restless world, for me reserv'd.\nWhat! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv'd,\nHad we both perish'd?\"--\"Look!\" the sage replied,\n\"Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,\nOf divers brilliances? 'tis the edifice\nI told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;\nAnd where I have enshrined piously\nAll lovers, whom fell storms have doom'd to die\nThroughout my bondage.\" Thus discoursing, on\nThey went till unobscur'd the porches shone;\nWhich hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight.\nSure never since king Neptune held his state\nWas seen such wonder underneath the stars.\nTurn to some level plain where haughty Mars\nHas legion'd all his battle; and behold\nHow every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold\nHis even breast: see, many steeled squares,\nAnd rigid ranks of iron--whence who dares\nOne step? Imagine further, line by line,\nThese warrior thousands on the field supine:--\nSo in that crystal place, in silent rows,\nPoor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.--\nThe stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd\nSuch thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;\nSuch ranges of white feet, and patient lips\nAll ruddy,--for here death no blossom nips.\nHe mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair\nPut sleekly on one side with nicest care;\nAnd each one's gentle wrists, with reverence,\nPut cross-wise to its heart.\n\n                              \"Let us commence,\nWhisper'd the guide, stuttering with joy, even now.\"\nHe spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,\nBegan to tear his scroll in pieces small,\nUttering the while some mumblings funeral.\nHe tore it into pieces small as snow\nThat drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;\nAnd having done it, took his dark blue cloak\nAnd bound it round Endymion: then struck\nHis wand against the empty air times nine.--\n\"What more there is to do, young man, is thine:\nBut first a little patience; first undo\nThis tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.\nAh, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;\nAnd shouldst thou break it--What, is it done so clean?\nA power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!\nThe spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.\nHere is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,\nNor mark'd with any sign or charactery--\nCanst thou read aught? O read for pity's sake!\nOlympus! we are safe! Now, Carian, break\nThis wand against yon lyre on the pedestal.\"\n\n  'Twas done: and straight with sudden swell and fall\nSweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd\nA lullaby to silence.--\"Youth! now strew\nThese minced leaves on me, and passing through\nThose files of dead, scatter the same around,\nAnd thou wilt see the issue.\"--'Mid the sound\nOf flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,\nEndymion from Glaucus stood apart,\nAnd scatter'd in his face some fragments light.\nHow lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight\nSmiling beneath a coral diadem,\nOut-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,\nAppear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,\nKneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force\nPress'd its cold hand, and wept--and Scylla sigh'd!\nEndymion, with quick hand, the charm applied--\nThe nymph arose: he left them to their joy,\nAnd onward went upon his high employ,\nShowering those powerful fragments on the dead.\nAnd, as he pass'd, each lifted up its head,\nAs doth a flower at Apollo's touch.\nDeath felt it to his inwards; 'twas too much:\nDeath fell a weeping in his charnel-house.\nThe Latmian persever'd along, and thus\nAll were re-animated. There arose\nA noise of harmony, pulses and throes\nOf gladness in the air--while many, who\nHad died in mutual arms devout and true,\nSprang to each other madly; and the rest\nFelt a high certainty of being blest.\nThey gaz'd upon Endymion. Enchantment\nGrew drunken, and would have its head and bent.\nDelicious symphonies, like airy flowers,\nBudded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers\nOf light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.\nThe two deliverers tasted a pure wine\nOf happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out.\nSpeechless they eyed each other, and about\nThe fair assembly wander'd to and fro,\nDistracted with the richest overflow\nOf joy that ever pour'd from heaven.\n\n                                    ----\"Away!\"\nShouted the new-born god; \"Follow, and pay\nOur piety to Neptunus supreme!\"--\nThen Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,\nThey led on first, bent to her meek surprise,\nThrough portal columns of a giant size,\nInto the vaulted, boundless emerald.\nJoyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,\nDown marble steps; pouring as easily\nAs hour-glass sand--and fast, as you might see\nSwallows obeying the south summer's call,\nOr swans upon a gentle waterfall.\n\n  Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,\nEre from among some rocks of glittering spar,\nJust within ken, they saw descending thick\nAnother multitude. Whereat more quick\nMoved either host. On a wide sand they met,\nAnd of those numbers every eye was wet;\nFor each their old love found. A murmuring rose,\nLike what was never heard in all the throes\nOf wind and waters: 'tis past human wit\nTo tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it.\n\n  This mighty consummation made, the host\nMov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost\nHuge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,\nAnd from the rear diminishing away,--\nTill a faint dawn surpris'd them. Glaucus cried,\n\"Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!\nGod Neptune's palaces!\" With noise increas'd,\nThey shoulder'd on towards that brightening east.\nAt every onward step proud domes arose\nIn prospect,--diamond gleams, and golden glows\nOf amber 'gainst their faces levelling.\nJoyous, and many as the leaves in spring,\nStill onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd.\nRich opal domes were seen, on high upheld\nBy jasper pillars, letting through their shafts\nA blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts\nEach gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:\nFor what poor mortals fragment up, as mere\nAs marble was there lavish, to the vast\nOf one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,\nEven for common bulk, those olden three,\nMemphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh.\n\n  As large, as bright, as colour'd as the bow\nOf Iris, when unfading it doth shew\nBeyond a silvery shower, was the arch\nThrough which this Paphian army took its march,\nInto the outer courts of Neptune's state:\nWhence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,\nTo which the leaders sped; but not half raught\nEre it burst open swift as fairy thought,\nAnd made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes\nLike callow eagles at the first sunrise.\nSoon with an eagle nativeness their gaze\nRipe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,\nAnd then, behold! large Neptune on his throne\nOf emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;\nAt his right hand stood winged Love, and on\nHis left sat smiling Beauty's paragon.\n\n  Far as the mariner on highest mast\nCan see all round upon the calmed vast,\nSo wide was Neptune's hall: and as the blue\nDoth vault the waters, so the waters drew\nTheir doming curtains, high, magnificent,\nAw'd from the throne aloof;--and when storm-rent\nDisclos'd the thunder-gloomings in Jove's air;\nBut sooth'd as now, flash'd sudden everywhere,\nNoiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering\nDeath to a human eye: for there did spring\nFrom natural west, and east, and south, and north,\nA light as of four sunsets, blazing forth\nA gold-green zenith 'bove the Sea-God's head.\nOf lucid depth the floor, and far outspread\nAs breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe\nOf feather'd Indian darts about, as through\nThe delicatest air: air verily,\nBut for the portraiture of clouds and sky:\nThis palace floor breath-air,--but for the amaze\nOf deep-seen wonders motionless,--and blaze\nOf the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,\nGlobing a golden sphere.\n\n                          They stood in dreams\nTill Triton blew his horn. The palace rang;\nThe Nereids danc'd; the Syrens faintly sang;\nAnd the great Sea-King bow'd his dripping head.\nThen Love took wing, and from his pinions shed\nOn all the multitude a nectarous dew.\nThe ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew\nFair Scylla and her guides to conference;\nAnd when they reach'd the throned eminence\nShe kist the sea-nymph's cheek,--who sat her down\nA toying with the doves. Then,--\"Mighty crown\nAnd sceptre of this kingdom!\" Venus said,\n\"Thy vows were on a time to Nais paid:\nBehold!\"--Two copious tear-drops instant fell\nFrom the God's large eyes; he smil'd delectable,\nAnd over Glaucus held his blessing hands.--\n\"Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands\nOf love? Now this is cruel. Since the hour\nI met thee in earth's bosom, all my power\nHave I put forth to serve thee. What, not yet\nEscap'd from dull mortality's harsh net?\nA little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,\nOr I am skilless quite: an idle tongue,\nA humid eye, and steps luxurious,\nWhere these are new and strange, are ominous.\nAye, I have seen these signs in one of heaven,\nWhen others were all blind; and were I given\nTo utter secrets, haply I might say\nSome pleasant words:--but Love will have his day.\nSo wait awhile expectant. Pr'ythee soon,\nEven in the passing of thine honey-moon,\nVisit my Cytherea: thou wilt find\nCupid well-natured, my Adonis kind;\nAnd pray persuade with thee--Ah, I have done,\nAll blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!\"--\nThus the fair goddess: while Endymion\nKnelt to receive those accents halcyon.\n\n  Meantime a glorious revelry began\nBefore the Water-Monarch. Nectar ran\nIn courteous fountains to all cups outreach'd;\nAnd plunder'd vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach'd\nNew growth about each shell and pendent lyre;\nThe which, in disentangling for their fire,\nPull'd down fresh foliage and coverture\nFor dainty toying. Cupid, empire-sure,\nFlutter'd and laugh'd, and oft-times through the throng\nMade a delighted way. Then dance, and song,\nAnd garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd.\nIn harmless tendril they each other chain'd,\nAnd strove who should be smother'd deepest in\nFresh crush of leaves.\n\n                          O 'tis a very sin\nFor one so weak to venture his poor verse\nIn such a place as this. O do not curse,\nHigh Muses! let him hurry to the ending.\n\n  All suddenly were silent. A soft blending\nOf dulcet instruments came charmingly;\nAnd then a hymn.\n\n                    \"KING of the stormy sea!\nBrother of Jove, and co-inheritor\nOf elements! Eternally before\nThee the waves awful bow. Fast, stubborn rock,\nAt thy fear'd trident shrinking, doth unlock\nIts deep foundations, hissing into foam.\nAll mountain-rivers lost, in the wide home\nOf thy capacious bosom ever flow.\nThou frownest, and old Eolus thy foe\nSkulks to his cavern, 'mid the gruff complaint\nOf all his rebel tempests. Dark clouds faint\nWhen, from thy diadem, a silver gleam\nSlants over blue dominion. Thy bright team\nGulphs in the morning light, and scuds along\nTo bring thee nearer to that golden song\nApollo singeth, while his chariot\nWaits at the doors of heaven. Thou art not\nFor scenes like this: an empire stern hast thou;\nAnd it hath furrow'd that large front: yet now,\nAs newly come of heaven, dost thou sit\nTo blend and interknit\nSubdued majesty with this glad time.\nO shell-borne King sublime!\nWe lay our hearts before thee evermore--\nWe sing, and we adore!\n\n  \"Breathe softly, flutes;\nBe tender of your strings, ye soothing lutes;\nNor be the trumpet heard! O vain, O vain;\nNot flowers budding in an April rain,\nNor breath of sleeping dove, nor river's flow,--\nNo, nor the Eolian twang of Love's own bow,\nCan mingle music fit for the soft ear\nOf goddess Cytherea!\nYet deign, white Queen of Beauty, thy fair eyes\nOn our souls' sacrifice.\n\n  \"Bright-winged Child!\nWho has another care when thou hast smil'd?\nUnfortunates on earth, we see at last\nAll death-shadows, and glooms that overcast\nOur spirits, fann'd away by thy light pinions.\nO sweetest essence! sweetest of all minions!\nGod of warm pulses, and dishevell'd hair,\nAnd panting bosoms bare!\nDear unseen light in darkness! eclipser\nOf light in light! delicious poisoner!\nThy venom'd goblet will we quaff until\nWe fill--we fill!\nAnd by thy Mother's lips----\"\n\n\n                         Was heard no more\nFor clamour, when the golden palace door\nOpened again, and from without, in shone\nA new magnificence. On oozy throne\nSmooth-moving came Oceanus the old,\nTo take a latest glimpse at his sheep-fold,\nBefore he went into his quiet cave\nTo muse for ever--Then a lucid wave,\nScoop'd from its trembling sisters of mid-sea,\nAfloat, and pillowing up the majesty\nOf Doris, and the Egean seer, her spouse--\nNext, on a dolphin, clad in laurel boughs,\nTheban Amphion leaning on his lute:\nHis fingers went across it--All were mute\nTo gaze on Amphitrite, queen of pearls,\nAnd Thetis pearly too.--\n\n                           The palace whirls\nAround giddy Endymion; seeing he\nWas there far strayed from mortality.\nHe could not bear it--shut his eyes in vain;\nImagination gave a dizzier pain.\n\"O I shall die! sweet Venus, be my stay!\nWhere is my lovely mistress? Well-away!\nI die--I hear her voice--I feel my wing--\"\nAt Neptune's feet he sank. A sudden ring\nOf Nereids were about him, in kind strife\nTo usher back his spirit into life:\nBut still he slept. At last they interwove\nTheir cradling arms, and purpos'd to convey\nTowards a crystal bower far away.\n\n  Lo! while slow carried through the pitying crowd,\nTo his inward senses these words spake aloud;\nWritten in star-light on the dark above:\nDearest Endymion! my entire love!\nHow have I dwelt in fear of fate: 'tis done--\nImmortal bliss for me too hast thou won.\nArise then! for the hen-dove shall not hatch\nHer ready eggs, before I'll kissing snatch\nThee into endless heaven. Awake! awake!\n\n  The youth at once arose: a placid lake\nCame quiet to his eyes; and forest green,\nCooler than all the wonders he had seen,\nLull'd with its simple song his fluttering breast.\nHow happy once again in grassy nest!"},{"title":"Not at Home to Callers","author":"Emily Dickinson","text":"Not at Home to Callers\nSays the Naked Tree --\nBonnet due in April --\nWishing you Good Day

than effort can;\nI'll draw my curtain and consult the skies:\nThese trembling stars at dead of night look wan,\nWild, restless, strange, yet cannot be more drear\nThan this my couch, shared by a

warn an unjust judge of destiny:\nI, slumbering, heard and saw; awake I know,\nChrist's coming death, and Pilate's life of woe.\n\nI do not weep for Pilate­who could prove\nRegret for him whose cold and crushing sway\nNo prayer can soften, no appeal can move;\nWho tramples hearts as others trample clay,\nYet with a faltering, an uncertain tread,\nThat might stir up reprisal in the dead.\n\nForced to sit by his side and see his deeds;\nForced to behold that visage, hour by hour,\nIn whose gaunt lines, the abhorrent gazer reads\nA triple lust of gold, and blood, and power;\nA soul whom motives, fierce, yet abject, urge\nRome's servile slave, and Judah's tyrant scourge.\n\nHow can I love, or mourn, or pity him ?\nI, who so long my fettered hands have wrung;\n\nI, who for grief have wept my eye-sight dim;\nBecause, while life for me was bright and young,\nHe robbed my youth­he quenched my life's fair ray­\nHe crushed my mind, and did my freedom slay.\n\n\nAnd at this hour­although I be his wife­\nHe has no more of tenderness from me\nThan any other wretch of guilty life;\nLess, for I know his household privacy­\nI see him as he is­without a screen;\nAnd, by the gods, my soul abhors his mien !\n\nHas he not sought my presence, dyed in blood­\nInnocent, righteous blood, shed shamelessly ?\nAnd have I not his red salute withstood ?\nAye,­when, as erst, he plunged all Galilee\nIn dark bereavement­in affliction sore,\nMingling their very offerings with their gore.\n\nThen came he­in his eyes a serpent-smile,\nUpon his lips some false, endearing word,\nAnd, through the streets of Salem, clanged the while,\nHis slaughtering, hacking, sacrilegious sword­\nAnd I, to see a man cause men such woe,\nTrembled with ire­I did not fear to show.\n\nAnd now, the envious Jewish priests have brought\nJesus­whom they in mockery call their king­\n\nTo have, by this grim power, their vengeance wrought;\nBy this mean reptile, innocence to sting.\nOh ! could I but the purposed doom avert,\nAnd shield the blameless head from cruel hurt!\n\nAccessible is Pilate's heart to fear,\nOmens will shake his soul, like autumn leaf;\nCould he this night's appalling vision hear,\nThis just man's bonds were loosed, his life were safe,\nUnless that bitter priesthood should prevail,\nAnd make even terror to their malice quail.\n\nYet if I tell the dream­but let me pause.\nWhat dream ?

hear,\nThe hostile banners blaze against the sky\nAnd by the embassies mobs rage and cry.\nNow war has come, and peace is at an end.\nOn Paris town the German troops descend.\nThey are turned back, and driven to Champagne.\nAnd now, as to so many weary men,\nThe glorious temple gives them welcome, when\nIt meets them at the bottom of the plain.\nAt once, they set their cannon in its way.\nThere is no gable now, nor wall\nThat does not suffer, night and day,\nAs shot and shell in crushing torrents fall.\nThe stricken tocsin quivers through the tower;\nThe triple nave, the apse, the lonely

space,\nThe transepts, columns, windows gray and gold,\nThe organ, in whose tones the ocean rolled,\nThe crypts, of mighty shades the dwelling places,\nThe Virgin's gentle hands, the Saints' pure

overthrown!\nThe crawling flames, like adders glistening\nAte the white fabric of this lovely thing.\nNow from its soul arose a piteous moan,\nThe soul that always loved the just and fair.\nGranite and marble loud their woe confessed,\nThe silver monstrances that Popes had blessed,\nThe chalices and lamps and crosiers rare\nWere seared and twisted by a flaming breath;\nThe horror everywhere did range and swell,\nThe guardian Saints into this furnace fell,\nTheir bitter tears and screams were stilled in death.\nAround the flames armed hosts are skirmishing,\nThe burning sun reflects the lurid scene;\nThe German army, fighting for its life,\nRallies its torn and terrified left wing;\nAnd, as they near this place\nThe imperial eagles see\nBefore them in their flight,\nHere, in the solemn

to them,\nAnd discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul.\n\nWas it doubted that those who corrupt their own bodies conceal themselves;\nAnd if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?\nAnd if the body does not do as much as the Soul?\nAnd if the body were not the Soul, what is the Soul?\n\n2\nThe love of the Body of man or woman balks account—the body itself balks account;\nThat of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.\n\nThe expression of the face balks account;\nBut the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face;\nIt is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists;\n\nIt is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees—dress does\n  not hide him;\nThe strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes through the cotton and flannel;\nTo see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more;\nYou linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.\n\nThe sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress,\n  their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,\nThe swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent\n  green-shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the\n  water,\nThe bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats—the horseman in his saddle,\nGirls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,\nThe group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives\n  waiting,\nThe female soothing a child—the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard,\nThe young fellow hoeing corn—the sleigh-driver guiding his six horses through the crowd,\n\nThe wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured,\n  native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown, after work,\nThe coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,\nThe upper-hold and the under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;\nThe march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through\n  clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,\nThe slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the\n  listening on the alert,\nThe natural, perfect, varied attitudes—the bent head, the curv’d neck, and the\n  counting;\nSuch-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the\n  little child,\nSwim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause,\n  listen, and count.\n\n3\nI know a man, a common farmer—the father of five sons;\nAnd in them were the fathers of sons—and in them were the fathers of sons.\n\nThis man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person;\nThe shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, and the\n  immeasurable meaning of his black eyes—the richness and breadth of his manners,\nThese I used to go and visit him to see—he was wise also;\nHe was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old—his sons were massive, clean,\n  bearded, tan-faced, handsome;\nThey and his daughters loved him—all who saw him loved him;\nThey did not love him by allowance—they loved him with personal love;\nHe drank water only—the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his\n  face;\nHe was a frequent gunner and fisher—he sail’d his boat himself—he had a fine one\n  presented to him by a ship-joiner—he had fowling-pieces, presented to him by men that\n  loved him;\nWhen he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him\n  out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang.\n\nYou would wish long and long to be with him—you would wish to sit by him in the boat,\n  that you and he might touch each other.\n\n4\nI have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough,\nTo stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,\nTo be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,\nTo pass among them, or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck\n  for a moment—what is this, then?\nI do not ask any more delight—I swim in it, as in a sea.\n\nThere is something in staying close to men and women, and looking on them, and in the\n  contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well;\nAll things please the soul—but these please the soul well.\n\n5\nThis is the female form;\nA divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot;\nIt attracts with fierce undeniable attraction!\nI am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor—all falls aside but\n  myself and it;\nBooks, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, the atmosphere and the clouds,\n  and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed;\nMad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it—the response likewise ungovernable;\nHair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands, all diffused—mine too\n  diffused;\nEbb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb—love-flesh swelling and deliciously\n  aching;\nLimitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and\n  delirious juice;\nBridegroom night of love, working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn;\nUndulating into the willing and yielding day,\nLost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day.\n\nThis is the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, the man is born of woman;\nThis is the bath of birth—this is the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.\n\nBe not ashamed, women—your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest;\nYou are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.\n\nThe female contains all qualities, and tempers them—she is in her place, and moves with\n  perfect balance;\nShe is all things duly veil’d—she is both passive and active;\nShe is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.\n\nAs I see my soul reflected in nature;\nAs I see through a mist, one with inexpressible completeness and beauty,\nSee the bent head, and arms folded over the breast—the female I see.\n\n6\nThe male is not less the soul, nor more—he too is in his place;\nHe too is all qualities—he is action and power;\nThe flush of the known universe is in him;\nScorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well;\nThe wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost, become him\n  well—pride is for him;\nThe full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul;\nKnowledge becomes him—he likes it always—he brings everything to the test of himself;\nWhatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail, he strikes soundings at last only\n  here;\n(Where else does he strike soundings, except here?)\n\nThe man’s body is sacred, and the woman’s body is sacred;\nNo matter who it is, it is

fainter.\n\nI cannot aid with my wringing fingers,\nI can but rush to the surf, and let it drench me and freeze upon me.\n\nI search with the crowd—not one of the company is wash’d to us alive;\nIn the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.\n\n12\nNow of the older war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn,\nWashington stands inside the lines—he stands on the intrench’d hills, amid a\n    crowd of\n  officers,\nHis face is cold and damp—he cannot repress the weeping drops,\nHe lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes—the color is blanch’d from his\n    cheeks,\nHe sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their parents.\n\nThe same, at last and at last, when peace is declared,\nHe stands in the room of the old tavern—the well-belov’d soldiers all pass\n    through,\nThe officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,\nThe chief encircles their necks with his arm, and kisses them on the cheek,\nHe kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another—he shakes hands, and bids good-by\n    to\n  the\n  army.\n\n13\nNow I tell what my mother told me to-day as we sat at dinner together,\nOf when she was a nearly grown girl, living home with her parents on the old homestead.\n\nA red squaw came one breakfast time to the old homestead,\nOn her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,\nHer hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop’d her face,\nHer step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke.\n\nMy mother look’d in delight and amazement at the stranger,\nShe look’d at the freshness of her tall-borne face, and full and pliant limbs,\nThe more she look’d upon her, she loved her,\nNever before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,\nShe made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace—she cook’d food for\n    her,\nShe had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.\n\nThe red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the afternoon she went\n    away,\nO my mother was loth to have her go away!\nAll the week she thought of her—she watch’d for her many a month,\nShe remember’d her many a winter and many a summer,\nBut the red squaw never came, nor was heard of there again.\n\n14\nNow Lucifer was not dead—or if he was, I am his sorrowful terrible heir;\nI have been wrong’d—I am oppress’d—I hate him that oppresses me,\nI will either destroy him, or he shall release me.\n\nDamn him! how he does defile me!\nHow he informs against my brother and sister, and takes pay for their blood!\nHow he laughs when I look down the bend, after the steamboat that carries away my woman!\n\nNow the vast dusk bulk that is the whale’s bulk, it seems mine;\nWarily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and sluggish, the tap of my flukes is death.\n\n15\nA show of the summer softness! a contact of something unseen! an amour of the light and\n    air!\nI am jealous, and overwhelm’d with friendliness,\nAnd will go gallivant with the light and air myself,\nAnd have an unseen something to be in contact with them also.\n\nO love and summer! you are in the dreams, and in me!\nAutumn and winter are in the dreams—the

home,\nThe fugitive returns unharm’d—the immigrant is back beyond months and years,\nThe poor Irishman lives in the simple house of his childhood, with the well-known\n    neighbors and\n  faces,\nThey warmly welcome him—he is barefoot again, he forgets he is well off;\nThe Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman and Welshman voyage home, and the native of\n    the\n  Mediterranean voyages home,\nTo every port of England, France, Spain, enter well-fill’d ships,\nThe Swiss foots it toward his hills—the Prussian goes his way, the Hungarian his way,\n    and\n  the\n  Pole his way,\nThe Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian return.\n\n17\nThe homeward bound, and the outward bound,\nThe beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuyé, the onanist, the female that loves\n    unrequited,\n  the\n  money-maker,\nThe actor and actress, those through with their parts, and those waiting to commence,\nThe affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the voter, the nominee that is

vegetation.\n\nOr I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic;\nAnd it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,\nGrowing among black folks as among white;\nKanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the\n  same.\n\nAnd now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.\n\nTenderly will I use you, curling grass;\nIt may be you transpire from the breasts of young men;\nIt may be if I had known them I would have loved them;\nIt may be you are from old people, and from women, and from offspring taken soon\n  out of their mothers’ laps;\nAnd here you are the mothers’ laps.\n\nThis grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers;\nDarker than the colorless beards of old men;\nDark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.\n\nO I perceive after all so many uttering tongues!\nAnd I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.\n\nI wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,\nAnd the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of\n  their laps.\n\nWhat do you think has become of the young and old men?\nAnd what do you think has become of the women and children?\n\nThey are alive and well somewhere;\nThe smallest sprout shows there is really no death;\nAnd if ever there was, it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to\n  arrest it,\nAnd ceas’d the moment life appear’d.\n\nAll goes onward and outward—nothing collapses;\nAnd to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.\n\n7\nHas any one supposed it lucky to be born?\nI hasten to inform him or her, it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.\n\nI pass death with the dying, and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not\n  contain’d between my hat and boots;\nAnd peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and every one good;\nThe earth good, and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.\n\nI am not an earth, nor an adjunct of an earth;\nI am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as\n  myself;\n(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)\n\nEvery kind for itself and its own—for me mine, male and female;\nFor me those that have been boys, and that love women;\nFor me the man that is proud, and feels how it stings to be slighted;\nFor me the sweet-heart and the old maid—for me mothers, and the mothers of\n  mothers;\nFor me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears;\nFor me children, and the begetters of children.\n\nUndrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor discarded;\nI see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether or no;\nAnd am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.\n\n8\nThe little one sleeps in its cradle;\nI lift the gauze, and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my\n  hand.\n\nThe youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill;\nI peeringly view them from the top.\n\nThe suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bed-room;\nI witness the corpse with its dabbled hair—I note where the pistol has\n  fallen.\n\nThe blab of the pave, the tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the\n  promenaders;\nThe heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the\n  shod horses on the granite floor;\nThe snow-sleighs, the clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snowballs;\nThe hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous’d mobs;\nThe flap of the curtain’d litter, a sick man inside, borne to the hospital;\nThe meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall;\nThe excited crowd, the policeman with his star, quickly working his passage to\n  the centre of the crowd;\nThe impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes;\nWhat groans of over-fed or half-starv’d who fall sun-struck, or in fits;\nWhat exclamations of women taken suddenly, who hurry home and give birth to\n  babes;\nWhat living and buried speech is always vibrating here—what howls\n  restrain’d by decorum;\nArrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections\n  with convex lips;\nI mind them or the show or resonance of them—I come, and I depart.\n\n9\nThe big doors of the country barn stand open and ready;\nThe dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon;\nThe clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged;\nThe armfuls are pack’d to the sagging mow.\n\nI am there—I help—I came stretch’d atop of the load;\nI felt its soft jolts—one leg reclined on the other;\nI jump from the cross-beams, and seize the clover and timothy,\nAnd roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full of wisps.\n\n10\nAlone, far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt,\nWandering, amazed at my own lightness and glee;\nIn the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,\nKindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game;\nFalling asleep on the gather’d leaves, with my dog and gun by my side.\n\nThe Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails—she cuts the sparkle and scud;\nMy eyes settle the land—I bend at her prow, or shout joyously from the\n  deck.\n\nThe boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me;\nI tuck’d my trowser-ends in my boots, and went and had a good time:\n(You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.)\n\nI saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west—the bride\n  was a red girl;\nHer father and his friends sat near, cross-legged and dumbly smoking—they\n  had moccasins to their feet, and large thick blankets hanging from their\n  shoulders;\nOn a bank lounged the trapper—he was drest mostly in skins—his\n  luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck—he held his bride by the hand;\n\nShe had long eyelashes—her head was bare—her coarse straight locks\n  descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach’d to her feet.\n\nThe runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside;\nI heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile;\nThrough the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,\nAnd went where he sat on a log, and led him in and assured him,\nAnd brought water, and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d\n  feet,\nAnd gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse\n  clean clothes,\nAnd remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,\nAnd remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;\nHe staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north;\n(I had him sit next me at table—my fire-lock lean’d in the corner.)\n\n11\nTwenty-eight young men bathe by the shore;\nTwenty-eight young men, and all so friendly:\nTwenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so lonesome.\n\nShe owns the fine house by the rise of the bank;\nShe hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the blinds of the window.\n\nWhich of the young men does she like the best?\nAh, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.\n\nWhere are you off to, lady? for I see you;\nYou splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.\n\nDancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather;\nThe rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.\n\nThe beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long\n  hair:\nLittle streams pass’d all over their bodies.\n\nAn unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies;\nIt descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.\n\nThe young men float on their backs—their white bellies bulge to the\n  sun—they do not ask who seizes fast to them;\nThey do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch;\nThey do not think whom they souse with spray.\n\n12\nThe butcher-boy puts off his killing clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall\n  in the market;\nI loiter, enjoying his repartee, and his shuffle and break-down.\n\nBlacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil;\nEach has his main-sledge—they are all out—(there is a great heat in\n  the fire.)\n\nFrom the cinder-strew’d threshold I follow their movements;\nThe lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms;\nOver-hand the hammers swing—over-hand so slow—over-hand so sure:\nThey do not hasten—each man hits in his place.\n\n13\nThe negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses—the block swags\n  underneath on its tied-over chain;\nThe negro that drives the dray of the stone-yard—steady and tall he stands,\n  pois’d on one leg on the string-piece;\nHis blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast, and loosens over his hip-band;\n\nHis glance is calm and commanding—he tosses the slouch of his hat away from\n  his forehead;\nThe sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache—falls on the black of his\n  polish’d and perfect limbs.\n\nI behold the picturesque giant, and love him—and I do not stop there;\nI go with the team also.\n\nIn me the caresser of life wherever moving—backward as well as forward\n  slueing;\nTo niches aside and junior bending.\n\nOxen that rattle the yoke and chain, or halt in the leafy shade! what is that\n  you express in your eyes?\nIt seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.\n\nMy tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck, on my distant and day-long ramble;\n\nThey rise together—they slowly circle around.\n\nI believe in those wing’d purposes,\nAnd acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,\nAnd consider green and violet, and the tufted crown, intentional;\nAnd do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else;\nAnd the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me;\nAnd the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.\n\n14\nThe wild gander leads his flock through the cool night;\nYa-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation;\n(The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen close;\nI find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.)\n\nThe sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the\n  chickadee, the prairie-dog,\nThe litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,\nThe brood of the turkey-hen, and she with her half-spread wings;\nI see in them and myself the same old law.\n\nThe press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections;\nThey scorn the best I can do to relate them.\n\nI am enamour’d of growing out-doors,\nOf men that live among cattle, or taste of the ocean or woods,\nOf the builders and steerers of ships, and the wielders of axes and mauls, and\n  the drivers of horses;\nI can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.\n\nWhat is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me;\nMe going in for my chances, spending for vast returns;\nAdorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me;\nNot asking the sky to come down to my good will;\nScattering it freely forever.\n\n15\nThe pure contralto sings in the organ loft;\nThe carpenter dresses his plank—the tongue of his foreplane whistles its\n  wild ascending lisp;\nThe married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner;\nThe pilot seizes the king-pin—he heaves down with a strong arm;\nThe mate stands braced in the whale-boat—lance and harpoon are ready;\nThe duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches;\nThe deacons are ordain’d with cross’d hands at the altar;\nThe spinning-girl retreats and advances to

stove;\nThe machinist rolls up his sleeves—the policeman travels his beat—the\n  gate-keeper marks who pass;\nThe young fellow drives the express-wagon—(I love him, though I do not know\n  him;)\nThe half-breed straps on his light boots to complete in the race;\nThe western turkey-shooting draws old and young—some lean on their rifles,\n  some sit on logs,\nOut from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;\nThe groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee;\nAs the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his\n  saddle;\nThe bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the\n  dancers bow to each other;\nThe youth lies awake in the cedar-roof’d garret, and harks to the musical\n  rain;\nThe Wolverine sets

his thread;\nThe conductor beats time for the band, and all the performers follow him;\nThe child is baptized—the convert is making his first professions;\nThe regatta is spread on the bay—the race is

This suits me.\n\nA tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me;\nThe orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.\n\nI hear the train’d soprano—(what work, with hers, is this?)\nThe orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies;\nIt wrenches such ardors from me, I did not know I possess’d them;\nIt sails me—I dab with bare feet—they are lick’d by the indolent\n  waves;\nI am exposed, cut by bitter and angry hail—I lose my breath,\nSteep’d amid honey’d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of\n  death;\nAt length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,\nAnd that we call BEING.\n\n27\nTo be, in any form—what is that?\n(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither;)\nIf nothing lay more develop’d, the quahaug in its callous shell were\n  enough.\n\nMine is no callous shell;\nI have instant conductors all over me, whether I pass or stop;\nThey seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.\n\nI merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy;\nTo touch my person to some one else’s is about as much as I can stand.\n\n28\nIs this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,\nFlames and ether making a rush for my veins,\nTreacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,\nMy flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from\n  myself;\nOn all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,\nStraining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,\nBehaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,\nDepriving me of my best, as for a purpose,\nUnbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,\nDeluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,\nImmodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,\nThey bribed to swap off with touch, and go and graze at the edges of me;\nNo consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger;\nFetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,\nThen all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.\n\nThe sentries desert every other part of me;\nThey have left me helpless to a red marauder;\nThey all come to the headland, to witness and assist against me.\n\nI am given up by traitors;\nI talk wildly—I have lost my wits—I and nobody else am the greatest\n  traitor;\nI went myself first to the headland—my own hands carried me there.\n\nYou villian touch! what are you doing? My breath is tight in its throat;\nUnclench your floodgates! you are too much for me.\n\n29\nBlind, loving, wrestling touch! sheath’d, hooded, sharp-tooth’d touch!\n\nDid it make you ache so, leaving me?\n\nParting, track’d by arriving—perpetual payment of perpetual loan;\nRich, showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.\n\nSprouts take and accumulate—stand by the curb prolific and vital:\nLandscapes, projected, masculine, full-sized and golden.\n\n30\nAll truths wait in all things;\nThey neither hasten their own delivery, nor resist it;\nThey do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon;\nThe insignificant is as big to me as any;\n(What is less or more than a touch?)\n\nLogic and sermons never convince;\nThe damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.\n\nOnly what proves itself to every man and woman is so;\nOnly what nobody denies is so.\n\nA minute and a drop of me settle my brain;\nI believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,\nAnd a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,\nAnd a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,\nAnd they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,\nAnd until every one shall delight us, and we them.\n\n31\nI believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,\nAnd the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the\n  wren,\nAnd the tree-toad is a chef-d’oeuvre for the highest,\nAnd the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,\nAnd the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,\nAnd the cow crunching with depress’d head surpasses any statue,\nAnd a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels,\nAnd I could come every afternoon of my life to look at the farmer’s girl\n  boiling her iron tea-kettle and baking shortcake.\n\nI find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent\n  roots,\nAnd am stucco’d with quadrupeds and birds all over,\nAnd have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,\nAnd call anything close again, when I desire it.\n\nIn vain the speeding or shyness;\nIn vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach;\nIn vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder’d bones;\nIn vain objects stand leagues off, and assume manifold shapes;\nIn vain the ocean settling in hollows, and the great monsters lying low;\nIn vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky;\nIn vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs;\nIn vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods;\nIn vain the razor-bill’d auk sails far north to Labrador;\nI follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.\n\n32\nI think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and\n  self-contain’d;\nI stand and look at them long and long.\n\nThey do not sweat and whine about their condition;\nThey do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins;\nThey do not make me sick discussing their duty to God;\nNot one is dissatisfied—not one is demented with the mania of owning\n  things;\nNot one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago;\nNot one is respectable or industrious over the whole earth.\n\nSo they show their relations to me, and I accept them;\nThey bring me tokens of myself—they evince them plainly in their\n  possession.\n\nI wonder where they get those tokens:\nDid I pass that way huge times ago, and negligently drop them?\nMyself moving forward then and now and forever,\nGathering and showing more always and with velocity,\nInfinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them;\nNot too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers;\nPicking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.\n\nA gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,\nHead high in the forehead, wide between the ears,\nLimbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,\nEyes full of sparkling wickedness—ears finely cut, flexibly moving.\n\nHis nostrils dilate, as my heels embrace him;\nHis well-built limbs tremble with pleasure, as we race around and return.\n\nI but use you a moment, then I resign you, stallion;\nWhy do I need your paces, when I myself out-gallop them?\nEven, as I stand or sit, passing faster than you.\n\n33\nO swift wind! O space and time! now I see it is true, what I guessed at;\nWhat I guess’d when I loaf’d on the grass;\nWhat I guess’d while I lay alone in my bed,\nAnd again as I walk’d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.\n\nMy ties and ballasts leave me—I travel—I sail—my elbows rest in\n  the sea-gaps;\nI skirt the sierras—my palms cover continents;\nI am afoot with my vision.\n\nBy the city’s quadrangular houses—in log huts—camping with\n  lumbermen;\nAlong the ruts of the turnpike—along the dry gulch and rivulet bed;\nWeeding my onion-patch, or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips—crossing\n  savannas—trailing in forests;\nProspecting—gold-digging—girdling the trees of a new purchase;\nScorch’d ankle-deep by the hot sand—hauling my boat down the shallow\n  river;\nWhere the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead—where the buck turns\n  furiously at the hunter;\nWhere the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock—where the otter is\n  feeding on fish;\nWhere the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou;\nWhere the black bear is searching for roots or honey—where the beaver pats\n  the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;\nOver the growing sugar—over the yellow-flower’d cotton plant—over\n  the rice in its low moist field;\nOver the sharp-peak’d farm house, with its scallop’d scum and slender\n  shoots from the gutters;\nOver the western persimmon—over the long-leav’d corn—over the\n  delicate blue-flower flax;\nOver the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest;\nOver the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;\nScaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged\n  limbs;\nWalking the path worn in the grass, and beat through the leaves of the brush;\nWhere the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot;\nWhere the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve—where the great gold-bug drops\n  through the dark;\nWhere flails keep time on the barn floor;\nWhere the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow;\nWhere cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their\n  hides;\nWhere the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen—where andirons straddle the\n  hearth-slab—where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;\nWhere trip-hammers crash—where the press is whirling its cylinders;\nWherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs;\nWhere the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself, and\n  looking composedly down;)\nWhere the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose—where the heat hatches\n  pale-green eggs in the dented sand;\nWhere the she-whale swims with her calf, and never forsakes it;\nWhere the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke;\nWhere the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water;\nWhere the half-burn’d brig is riding on unknown currents,\nWhere shells grow to her slimy deck—where the dead are corrupting below;\nWhere the dense-starr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments;\nApproaching Manhattan, up by the long-stretching island;\nUnder Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance;\nUpon a door-step—upon the horse-block of hard wood outside;\nUpon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs, or a good game of base-ball;\nAt he-festivals, with blackguard jibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking,\n  laughter;\nAt the cider-mill, tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice\n  through a straw;\nAt apple-peelings, wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find;\nAt musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings:\nWhere the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps;\nWhere the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard—where the dry-stalks are\n  scattered—where the brood-cow waits in the hovel;\nWhere the bull advances to do his masculine work—where the stud to the\n  mare—where the cock is treading the hen;\nWhere the heifers browse—where geese nip their food with short jerks;\nWhere sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie;\nWhere herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near;\nWhere the humming-bird shimmers—where the neck of the long-lived swan is\n  curving and winding;\nWhere the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human\n  laugh;\nWhere bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden, half hid by the high weeds;\n\nWhere band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads\n  out;\nWhere burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery;\nWhere winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees;\nWhere the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and\n  feeds upon small crabs;\nWhere the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon;\nWhere the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well;\nThrough patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves;\nThrough the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs;\nThrough the gymnasium—through the curtain’d saloon—through the\n  office or public hall;\nPleas’d with the native, and pleas’d with the\n  foreign—pleas’d with the new and old;\nPleas’d with women, the homely as well as the handsome;\nPleas’d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks\n  melodiously;\nPleas’d with the tune of the choir of the white-wash’d church;\nPleas’d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, or any\n  preacher—impress’d seriously at the camp-meeting:\nLooking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon—flatting the\n  flesh of my nose on the thick plate-glass;\nWandering the same afternoon with my face turn’d up to the clouds,\nMy right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle:\nComing home with the silent and dark-cheek’d bush-boy—(behind me he\n  rides at the drape of the day;)\nFar from the settlements, studying the print of animals’ feet, or the\n  moccasin print;\nBy the cot in the hospital, reaching lemonade to a feverish patient;\nNigh the coffin’d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle:\nVoyaging to every port, to dicker and adventure;\nHurrying with the modern crowd, as eager and fickle as any;\nHot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him;\nSolitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while;\nWalking the old hills of Judea, with the beautiful gentle God by my side;\nSpeeding through space—speeding through heaven and the stars;\nSpeeding amid the seven satellites, and the broad ring, and the diameter of\n  eighty thousand miles;\nSpeeding with tail’d meteors—throwing fire-balls like the rest;\nCarrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly;\nStorming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,\nBacking and filling, appearing and disappearing;\nI tread day and night such roads.\n\nI visit the orchards of spheres, and look at the product:\nAnd look at quintillions ripen’d, and look at quintillions green.\n\nI fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul;\nMy course runs below the soundings of plummets.\n\nI help myself to material and immaterial;\nNo guard can shut me off, nor law prevent me.\n\nI anchor my ship for a little while only;\nMy messengers continually cruise away, or bring their returns to me.\n\nI go hunting polar furs and the seal—leaping chasms with a pike-pointed\n  staff—clinging to topples of brittle and blue.\n\nI ascend to the foretruck;\nI take my place late at night in the crow’s-nest;\nWe sail the arctic sea—it is plenty light enough;\nThrough the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty;\nThe enormous masses of ice pass me, and I pass them—the scenery is plain in\n  all directions;\nThe white-topt mountains show in the distance—I fling out my fancies toward\n  them;\n(We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged;\nWe pass the colossal outposts of the encampment—we pass with still feet and\n  caution;\nOr we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city;\nThe blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the\n  globe.)\n\nI am a free companion—I bivouac by invading watchfires.\n\nI turn the bridegroom out of bed, and stay with the bride myself;\nI tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.\n\nMy voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs;\nThey fetch my man’s body up, dripping and drown’d.\n\nI understand the large hearts of heroes,\nThe courage of present times and all times;\nHow the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and\n  Death chasing it up and down the storm;\nHow he knuckled tight, and gave not back one inch, and was faithful of days and\n  faithful of nights,\nAnd chalk’d in large letters, on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not\n  desert you:\nHow he follow’d with them, and tack’d with them—and would not\n  give it up;\nHow he saved the drifting company at last:\nHow the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of\n  their prepared graves;\nHow the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d\n  unshaved men:\nAll this I swallow—it tastes good—I like it well—it becomes mine;\nI am the man—I suffer’d—I was there.\n\nThe disdain and calmness of olden martyrs;\nThe mother, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing\n  on;\nThe hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing,\n  cover’d with sweat;\nThe twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck—the murderous\n  buckshot and the bullets;\nAll these I feel, or am.\n\nI am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,\nHell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen;\nI clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn’d with the ooze of my\n  skin;\nI fall on the weeds and stones;\nThe riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,\nTaunt my dizzy ears, and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.\n\nAgonies are one of my changes of garments;\nI do not ask the wounded person how he feels—I myself become the wounded\n  person;\nMy hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.\n\nI am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken;\nTumbling walls buried me in their debris;\nHeat and smoke I inspired—I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades;\nI heard the distant click of their picks and shovels;\nThey have clear’d the beams away—they tenderly lift me forth.\n\nI lie in the night air in my red shirt—the pervading hush is for my sake;\nPainless after all I lie, exhausted but not so unhappy;\nWhite and beautiful are the faces around me—the heads are bared of their\n  fire-caps;\nThe kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.\n\nDistant and dead resuscitate;\nThey show as the dial or move as the hands of me—I am the clock myself.\n\nI am an old artillerist—I tell of my fort’s bombardment;\nI am there again.\n\nAgain the long roll of the drummers;\nAgain the attacking cannon, mortars;\nAgain, to my listening ears, the cannon responsive.\n\nI take part—I see and hear the whole;\nThe cries, curses, roar—the plaudits for well-aim’d shots;\nThe ambulanza slowly passing, trailing its red drip;\nWorkmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs;\nThe fall of grenades through the rent roof—the fan-shaped explosion;\nThe whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.\n\nAgain gurgles the mouth of my dying general—he furiously waves with his\n  hand;\nHe gasps through the clot, Mind not me—mind—the entrenchments.\n\n34\nNow I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth;\n(I tell not the fall of Alamo,\nNot one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,\nThe hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo;)\n’Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young\n  men.\n\nRetreating, they had form’d in a hollow square, with their baggage for\n  breastworks;\nNine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy’s, nine times their number,\n  was the price they took in advance;\nTheir colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone;\nThey treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave\n  up their arms, and march’d back prisoners of war.\n\nThey were the glory of the race of rangers;\nMatchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,\nLarge, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,\nBearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,\nNot a single one over thirty years of age.\n\nThe second First-day morning they were brought out in squads, and\n  massacred—it was beautiful early summer;\nThe work commenced about five o’clock, and was over by eight.\n\nNone obey’d the command to kneel;\nSome made a mad and helpless rush—some stood stark and straight;\nA few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart—the living and dead lay\n  together;\nThe maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt—the newcomers saw them there;\nSome, half-kill’d, attempted to crawl away;\nThese were despatch’d with bayonets, or batter’d with the blunts of\n  muskets;\nA youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to\n  release him;\nThe three were all torn, and cover’d with the boy’s blood.\n\nAt eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies:\nThat is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.\n\n35\nWould you hear of an old-fashion’d sea-fight?\nWould you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?\nList to the story as my grandmother’s father, the sailor, told it to me.\n\nOur foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you, (said

desert me not, while I live.\n\nSweet are the blooming cheeks of the living! sweet are the musical voices sounding!\nBut sweet, ah sweet, are the dead, with their silent eyes.\n\nDearest comrades! all is over and long gone;\nBut love is not over—and what love, O comrades!\nPerfume from battle-fields rising—up from foetor arising.\n\nPerfume therefore my chant, O love! immortal Love!\nGive me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers,\nShroud them, embalm them, cover them all over with tender pride!\n\nPerfume all! make all wholesome!\nMake these ashes to nourish and blossom,\nO love! O chant! solve all, fructify all with the last chemistry.\n\nGive me exhaustless—make me a fountain,\nThat I exhale love from me wherever I go, like a moist perennial dew,\nFor the ashes of all dead soldiers."},{"title":"To a Locomotive in Winter.","author":"Walt Whitman","text":"THEE for my recitative!\nThee in the driving storm, even as now—the snow—the winter-day declining;\nThee in thy

prophecy and indirection—a thought impalpable, to breathe, as air;\nA chorus of dryads, fading, departing—or hamadryads departing;\nA murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,\nVoice of a mighty dying tree in the Redwood forest dense.\n\nFarewell, my brethren,\nFarewell, O earth and sky—farewell, ye neighboring waters;\nMy time has ended, my term has come.\n\n2\nAlong the northern coast,\nJust back from the rock-bound shore, and the caves,\nIn the saline air from the sea, in the Mendocino country,\nWith the surge for bass and accompaniment low and hoarse,\nWith crackling blows of axes, sounding musically, driven by strong arms,\nRiven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes—there in the Redwood forest dense,\nI heard the mighty tree its death-chant chanting.\n\nThe choppers heard not—the camp shanties echoed not;\nThe quick-ear’d teamsters, and chain and jack-screw men, heard not,\nAs the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years, to join the refrain;\nBut in my soul I plainly heard.\n\nMurmuring out of its myriad leaves,\nDown from its lofty top, rising two hundred feet high,\nOut of its stalwart trunk and limbs—out of its foot-thick bark,\nThat chant of the seasons and time—chant, not of the past only, but the future.\n\n3\nYou untold life of me,\nAnd all you venerable and innocent joys,\nPerennial, hardy life of me, with joys, ’mid rain, and many a summer sun,\nAnd the white snows, and night, and the wild winds;\nO the great patient, rugged joys! my soul’s strong joys, unreck’d by man;\n(For know I bear the soul befitting me—I too have consciousness, identity,\nAnd all the rocks and mountains have—and all the earth;)\nJoys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,\nOur time, our term has come.\n\nNor yield we mournfully, majestic brothers,\nWe who have grandly fill’d our time;\nWith Nature’s calm content, and tacit, huge delight,\nWe welcome what we wrought for through the past,\nAnd leave the field for them.\n\nFor them predicted long,\nFor a superber Race—they too to grandly fill their time,\nFor them we abdicate—in them ourselves, ye forest kings!\nIn them these skies and airs—these mountain peaks—Shasta—Nevadas,\nThese huge, precipitous cliffs—this amplitude—these valleys grand—Yosemite,\nTo be in them absorb’d, assimilated.\n\n4\nThen to a loftier strain,\nStill prouder, more ecstatic, rose the chant,\nAs if the heirs, the Deities of the West,\nJoining, with master-tongue, bore part.\n\nNot wan from Asia’s fetishes,\nNor red from Europe’s old dynastic slaughter-house,\n(Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and scaffolds every\n  where,)\nBut come from Nature’s long and harmless throes—peacefully builded thence,\nThese virgin lands—Lands of the Western Shore,\nTo the new Culminating Man—to you, the Empire New,\nYou, promis’d long, we pledge, we dedicate.\n\nYou occult, deep volitions,\nYou average Spiritual Manhood, purpose of all, pois’d on yourself—giving, not taking\n  law,\nYou Womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence life and love, and aught that\n    comes\n  from life and love,\nYou unseen Moral Essence of all the vast materials of America, (age upon age,\n    working\n  in Death the same as Life,)\nYou that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and mould the New World,\n    adjusting\n  it to Time and Space,\nYou hidden National Will, lying in your abysms, conceal’d, but ever alert,\nYou past and present purposes, tenaciously pursued, may-be unconscious of\n    yourselves,\nUnswerv’d by all the passing errors, perturbations of the surface;\nYou vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds, arts, statutes,\n    literatures,\n\nHere build your homes for good—establish here—These areas entire, Lands of the Western\n  Shore,\nWe pledge, we dedicate to you.\n\nFor man of you—your characteristic Race,\nHere may be hardy, sweet, gigantic grow—here tower, proportionate to Nature,\nHere climb the vast, pure spaces, unconfined, uncheck’d by wall or roof,\nHere laugh with storm or sun—here joy—here patiently inure,\nHere heed himself, unfold himself (not others’ formulas heed)—here fill\n  his time,\nTo duly fall, to aid, unreck’d at last,\nTo disappear, to serve.\n\nThus, on the northern coast,\nIn the echo of teamsters’ calls, and the clinking chains, and the music of choppers’ axes,\n\nThe falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the groan,\nSuch words combined from the Redwood-tree—as of wood-spirits’ voices ecstatic, ancient and\n  rustling,\nThe century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,\nAll their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,\nFrom the Cascade range to the Wasatch—or Idaho far, or Utah,\nTo the deities of the Modern henceforth yielding,\nThe chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity—the settlements, features all,\nIn the Mendocino woods I caught.\n\n5\nThe flashing and golden pageant of California!\nThe sudden and gorgeous drama—the sunny and ample lands;\nThe long and varied stretch from Puget Sound to Colorado south;\nLands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air—valleys and mountain cliffs;\nThe fields of Nature long prepared and fallow—the silent, cyclic chemistry;\nThe slow and steady ages plodding—the unoccupied surface ripening—the rich ores forming\n  beneath;\nAt last the New arriving, assuming, taking possession,\nA swarming and busy race settling and organizing every where;\nShips coming in from the whole round world, and going out to the whole world,\nTo India and China and Australia, and the thousand island paradises of the Pacific;\nPopulous cities—the latest inventions—the steamers on the rivers—the railroads—with\n  many a thrifty farm, with machinery,\nAnd wool, and wheat, and the grape—and diggings of yellow gold.\n\n6\nBut more in you than these, Lands of the Western Shore!\n(These but the means, the implements, the standing-ground,)\nI see in you, certain to come, the promise of thousands of years, till now deferr’d,\nPromis’d, to be fulfill’d, our common kind, the Race.\n\nThe New Society at last, proportionate to Nature,\nIn Man of you, more than your mountain peaks, or stalwart trees imperial,\nIn Woman more, far more, than all your gold, or vines, or even vital air.\n\nFresh come, to a New World indeed,

itself;\nAll verges to it—all has reference to what ensues;\nAll that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence;\nNot a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day, month, any part of\n    the\n  direct\n  life-time, or the hour of death, but the same affects him or her onward afterward through\n    the\n  indirect life-time.\n\n3\nThe indirect is just as much as the direct,\nThe spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body, if not more.\n\nNot one word or deed—not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of the onanist,\n    putridity\n  of\n  gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning, betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution,\n    but\n  has\n  results beyond death, as really as before death.\n\n4\nCharity and personal force are the only investments worth anything.\n\nNo specification is necessary—all that a male or female does, that is vigorous,\n  benevolent,\n  clean, is so much profit to him or her, in the unshakable order of the universe, and\n    through\n  the\n  whole scope of it forever.\n\n5\nWho has been wise, receives interest,\nSavage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat, young, old, it is the\n    same,\nThe interest will come round—all will come round.\n\nSingly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect all of the past,\n    and\n  all of\n  the present, and all of the future,\nAll the brave actions of war and peace,\nAll help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful, young children, widows,\n    the\n  sick,\n  and to shunn’d persons,\nAll furtherance of fugitives, and of the escape of slaves,\nAll self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others fill the seats of\n    the\n  boats,\nAll offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a friend’s sake, or\n  opinion’s sake,\nAll pains of enthusiasts, scoff’d at by their neighbors,\nAll the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,\nAll honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,\nAll the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,\nAll the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name, date, location,\nAll that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,\nAll suggestions of the divine mind of man, or the divinity of his mouth, or the shaping of\n    his\n  great\n  hands;\nAll that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe—or on any of the\n  wandering\n  stars, or on any of the fix’d stars, by those there as we are here;\nAll that is henceforth to be thought or done by you, whoever you are, or by any one;\nThese inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which they sprang, or shall\n  spring.\n\n6\nDid you guess anything lived only its moment?\nThe world does not so exist—no parts palpable or impalpable so exist;\nNo consummation exists without being from some long previous consummation—and that\n    from\n  some\n  other,\nWithout the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the beginning than any.\n\n7\nWhatever satisfies Souls is true;\nPrudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of Souls;\nItself only finally satisfies the Soul;\nThe Soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson but its own.\n\n8\nNow I give you an inkling;\nNow I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time, space, reality,\nThat answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.\n\nWhat is prudence, is indivisible,\nDeclines to separate one part of life from every part,\nDivides not the righteous from the unrighteous, or the living from the dead,\nMatches every thought or act by its correlative,\nKnows no possible forgiveness, or deputed atonement,\nKnows that the young man who composedly peril’d his life and lost it, has done\n    exceedingly\n  well\n  for himself without doubt,\nThat he who never peril’d his life, but retains it to old age in riches and ease, has\n  probably\n  achiev’d nothing for himself worth mentioning;\nKnows that only that person has really learn’d, who has learn’d to prefer\n    results,\nWho favors Body and Soul the same,\nWho perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,\nWho in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries or, avoids death."},{"title":"When I heard at the Close of the Day.","author":"Walt Whitman","text":"WHEN I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receiv’d with plaudits in the\n  capitol,\n  still it was not a happy night for me that follow’d;\nAnd else, when I carous’d, or when my plans were accomplish’d, still I was not happy;\nBut the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect health, refresh’d, singing,\n    inhaling\n  the\n  ripe breath of autumn,\nWhen I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in the morning light,\nWhen I wander’d alone over the beach, and undressing, bathed, laughing with the cool\n    waters,\n  and\n  saw the sun rise,\nAnd when I thought how my dear friend, my lover, was on his way coming, O then I was\n    happy;\nO then each breath tasted sweeter—and all that day my food nourish’d me more—and the\n    beautiful\n  day pass’d well,\nAnd the next came with equal joy—and with the next, at evening, came my friend;\nAnd that night, while all was still, I heard the waters roll slowly continually up the\n    shores,\n\nI heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands, as directed to me, whispering, to\n  congratulate\n  me,\nFor the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover in the cool night,\nIn the stillness, in the autumn moonbeams, his face was inclined toward me,\nAnd his arm lay lightly around my breast—and that night I was happy."},{"title":"As I Sat Alone by Blue Ontario’s Shores.","author":"Walt Whitman","text":"1\nAS I sat alone, by blue Ontario’s shore,\nAs I mused of these mighty days, and of peace return’d, and the dead that return no\n    more,\nA Phantom, gigantic, superb, with stern visage, accosted me;\nChant me the poem, it said, that comes from the soul of America—chant me\n    the\n  carol of victory;\nAnd strike up the marches of Libertad—marches more powerful yet;\nAnd sing me before you go, the song of the throes of Democracy.\n\n(Democracy—the destin’d conqueror—yet treacherous lip-smiles everywhere,\nAnd Death and infidelity at every step.)\n\n2\nA Nation announcing itself,\nI myself make the only growth by which I can be appreciated,\nI reject none, accept all, then reproduce all in my own forms.\n\nA breed whose proof is in time and deeds;\nWhat we are, we are—nativity is answer enough to objections;\nWe wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded,\nWe are powerful and tremendous in ourselves,\nWe are executive in ourselves—We are sufficient in the variety of ourselves,\nWe are the most beautiful to ourselves, and in ourselves;\nWe stand self-pois’d in the middle, branching thence over the world;\nFrom Missouri, Nebraska, or Kansas, laughing attacks to scorn.\n\nNothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves,\nWhatever appears, whatever does not appear, we are beautiful or sinful in ourselves only.\n\n(O mother! O sisters dear!\nIf we are lost, no victor else has destroy’d us;\nIt is by ourselves we go down to eternal night.)\n\n3\nHave you thought there could be but a single Supreme?\nThere can be any number of Supremes—One does not countervail another, any more than\n    one\n  eyesight countervails another, or one life countervails another.\n\nAll is eligible to all,\nAll is for individuals—All is for you,\nNo condition is prohibited—not God’s, or any.\n\nAll comes by the body—only health puts you rapport with the universe.\n\nProduce great persons, the rest follows.\n\n4\nAmerica isolated I sing;\nI say that works made here in the spirit of other lands, are so much poison in The States.\n\n\n(How dare such insects as we see assume to write poems for America?\nFor our victorious armies, and the offspring following the armies?)\n\nPiety and conformity to them that like!\nPeace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like!\nI am he who tauntingly compels men, women, nations,\nCrying, Leap from your seats, and contend for your lives!\n\nI am he who walks the States with a barb’d tongue, questioning every one I meet;\nWho are you, that wanted only to be told what you knew before?\nWho are you, that wanted only a book to join you in your nonsense?\n\n(With pangs and cries, as thine own, O bearer of many children!\nThese clamors wild, to a race of pride I give.)\n\nO lands! would you be freer than all that has ever been before?\nIf you would be freer than all that has been before, come listen to me.\n\nFear grace—Fear elegance, civilization, delicatesse,\nFear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-juice;\nBeware the advancing mortal ripening of nature,\nBeware what precedes the decay of the ruggedness of states and men.\n\nAges, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,\nAmerica brings builders, and brings its own styles.\n\nThe immortal poets of Asia and Europe have done their work, and pass’d to other\n    spheres,\nA work remains, the work of surpassing all they have done.\n\nAmerica, curious toward foreign characters, stands by its own at all hazards,\nStands removed, spacious, composite, sound—initiates the true use of precedents,\nDoes not repel them, or the past, or what they have produced under their forms,\nTakes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne from the house,\nPerceives that it waits a little while in the door—that it was fittest for its days,\nThat its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who approaches,\nAnd that he shall be fittest for his days.\n\nAny period, one nation must lead,\nOne land must be the promise and reliance of the future.\n\nThese States are the amplest poem,\nHere is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation of nations,\nHere the doings of men correspond with the broadcast doings of the day and night,\nHere is what moves in magnificent masses, careless of particulars,\nHere are the roughs, beards, friendliness, combativeness, the Soul loves,\nHere the flowing trains—here the crowds, equality, diversity, the Soul loves.\n\n6\nLand of lands, and bards to corroborate!\nOf them, standing among them, one lifts to the light his west-bred face,\nTo him the hereditary countenance bequeath’d, both mother’s and father’s,\nHis first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,\nBuilt of the common stock, having room for far and near,\nUsed to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,\nAttracting it Body and Soul to himself, hanging on its neck with incomparable love,\nPlunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,\nMaking its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,\nMaking its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him,\nMississippi with yearly freshets and changing chutes—Columbia, Niagara, Hudson,\n    spending\n  themselves lovingly in him,\nIf the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast stretch, he stretching with them north\n    or\n  south,\nSpanning between them, east and west, and touching whatever is between them,\nGrowths growing from him to offset the growth of pine, cedar, hemlock, live-oak, locust,\n  chestnut, hickory, cottonwood, orange, magnolia,\nTangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or swamp,\nHe likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests coated with northern transparent ice,\nOff him pasturage, sweet and natural as savanna, upland, prairie,\nThrough him flights, whirls, screams, answering those of the fish-hawk, mocking-bird,\n  night-heron, and eagle;\nHis spirit surrounding his country’s spirit, unclosed to good and evil,\nSurrounding the essences of real things, old times and present times,\nSurrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of red aborigines,\nWeather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, embryo stature and muscle,\nThe haughty defiance of the Year 1—war, peace, the formation of the Constitution,\nThe separate States, the simple, elastic scheme, the immigrants,\nThe Union, always swarming with blatherers, and always sure and impregnable,\nThe unsurvey’d interior, log-houses, clearings, wild animals, hunters, trappers;\nSurrounding the multiform agriculture, mines, temperature, the gestation of new States,\nCongress convening every Twelfth-month, the members duly coming up from the uttermost\n    parts;\nSurrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially the young men,\nResponding their manners, speech, dress, friendships—the gait they have of persons\n    who\n  never knew how it felt to stand in the presence of superiors,\nThe freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and decision of their\n  phrenology,\nThe picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when wrong’d,\nThe fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity, good temper, and\n  open-handedness—the whole composite make,\nThe prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,\nThe perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement of the population,\nThe superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,\nWharf-hemm’d cities, railroad and steamboat lines, intersecting all points,\nFactories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the north-east, north-west,\n    south-west,\nManhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,\nSlavery—the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the ruins of all the\n    rest;\nOn and on to the grapple with it—Assassin! then your life or ours be the\n    stake—and\n  respite no more.\n\n7\n(Lo! high toward heaven, this day,\nLibertad! from the conqueress’ field return’d,\nI mark the new aureola around your head;\nNo more of soft astral, but dazzling and fierce,\nWith war’s flames, and the lambent lightnings

T. W.\nSometime trooper of the Royal Horse Guards\nobiit H.M. prison, Reading, Berkshire\nJuly 7, 1896)\n\nI\n\nHe did not wear his scarlet coat,\nFor blood and wine are red,\nAnd blood and wine were on his hands\nWhen they found him with the dead,\nThe poor dead woman whom he loved,\nAnd murdered in her bed.\n\nHe walked amongst the Trial Men\nIn a suit of shabby grey;\nA cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step seemed light and gay;\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every drifting cloud that went\nWith sails of silver by.\n\nI walked, with other souls in pain,\nWithin another ring,\nAnd was wondering if the man had done\nA great or little thing,\nWhen a voice behind me whispered low,\n'THAT FELLOW'S GOT TO SWING.'\n\nDear Christ! the very prison walls\nSuddenly seemed to reel,\nAnd the sky above my head became\nLike a casque of scorching steel;\nAnd, though I was a soul in pain,\nMy pain I could not feel.\n\nI only knew what hunted thought\nQuickened his step, and why\nHe looked upon the garish day\nWith such a wistful eye;\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\nAnd so he had to die.\n\n\nYet each man kills the thing he loves,\nBy each let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!\n\nSome kill their love when they are young,\nAnd some when they are old;\nSome strangle with the hands of Lust,\nSome with the hands of Gold:\nThe kindest use a knife, because\nThe dead so soon grow cold.\n\nSome love too little, some too long,\nSome sell, and others buy;\nSome do the deed with many tears,\nAnd some without a sigh:\nFor each man kills the thing he loves,\nYet each man does not die.\n\nHe does not die a death of shame\nOn a day of dark disgrace,\nNor have a noose about his neck,\nNor a cloth upon his face,\nNor drop feet foremost through the floor\nInto an empty space.\n\n\nHe does not sit with silent men\nWho watch him night and day;\nWho watch him when he tries to weep,\nAnd when he tries to pray;\nWho watch him lest himself should rob\nThe prison of its prey.\n\nHe does not wake at dawn to see\nDread figures throng his room,\nThe shivering Chaplain robed in white,\nThe Sheriff stern with gloom,\nAnd the Governor all in shiny black,\nWith the yellow face of Doom.\n\nHe does not rise in piteous haste\nTo put on convict-clothes,\nWhile some coarse-mouthed Doctor gloats,\nand notes\nEach new and nerve-twitched pose,\nFingering a watch whose little ticks\nAre like horrible hammer-blows.\n\nHe does not know that sickening thirst\nThat sands one's throat, before\nThe hangman with his gardener's gloves\nSlips through the padded door,\nAnd binds one with three leathern thongs,\nThat the throat may thirst no more.\n\nHe does not bend his head to hear\nThe Burial Office read,\nNor, while the terror of his soul\nTells him he is not dead,\nCross his own coffin, as he moves\nInto the hideous shed.\n\nHe does not stare upon the air\nThrough a little roof of glass:\nHe does not pray with lips of clay\nFor his agony to pass;\nNor feel upon his shuddering cheek\nThe kiss of Caiaphas.\n\n\nII\n\n\nSix weeks our guardsman walked the yard,\nIn the suit of shabby grey:\nHis cricket cap was on his head,\nAnd his step seemed light and gay,\nBut I never saw a man who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw a man who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWhich prisoners call the sky,\nAnd at every wandering cloud that trailed\nIts ravelled fleeces by.\n\nHe did not wring his hands, as do\nThose witless men who dare\nTo try to rear the changeling Hope\nIn the cave of black Despair:\nHe only looked upon the sun,\nAnd drank the morning air.\n\nHe did not wring his hands nor weep,\nNor did he peek or pine,\nBut he drank the air as though it held\nSome healthful anodyne;\nWith open mouth he drank the sun\nAs though it had been wine!\n\nAnd I and all the souls in pain,\nWho tramped the other ring,\nForgot if we ourselves had done\nA great or little thing,\nAnd watched with gaze of dull amaze\nThe man who had to swing.\n\nAnd strange it was to see him pass\nWith a step so light and gay,\nAnd strange it was to see him look\nSo wistfully at the day,\nAnd strange it was to think that he\nHad such a debt to pay.\n\n\nFor oak and elm have pleasant leaves\nThat in the springtime shoot:\nBut grim to see is the gallows-tree,\nWith its adder-bitten root,\nAnd, green or dry, a man must die\nBefore it bears its fruit!\n\nThe loftiest place is that seat of grace\nFor which all worldlings try:\nBut who would stand in hempen band\nUpon a scaffold high,\nAnd through a murderer's collar take\nHis last look at the sky?\n\nIt is sweet to dance to violins\nWhen Love and Life are fair:\nTo dance to flutes, to dance to lutes\nIs delicate and rare:\nBut it is not sweet with nimble feet\nTo dance upon the air!\n\nSo with curious eyes and sick surmise\nWe watched him day by day,\nAnd wondered if each one of us\nWould end the self-same way,\nFor none can tell to what red Hell\nHis sightless soul may stray.\n\nAt last the dead man walked no more\nAmongst the Trial Men,\nAnd I knew that he was standing up\nIn the black dock's dreadful pen,\nAnd that never would I see his face\nIn God's sweet world again.\n\nLike two doomed ships that pass in storm\nWe had crossed each other's way:\nBut we made no sign, we said no word,\nWe had no word to say;\nFor we did not meet in the holy night,\nBut in the shameful day.\n\nA prison wall was round us both,\nTwo outcast men we were:\nThe world had thrust us from its heart,\nAnd God from out His care:\nAnd the iron gin that waits for Sin\nHad caught us in its snare.\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIn Debtors' Yard the stones are hard,\nAnd the dripping wall is high,\nSo it was there he took the air\nBeneath the leaden sky,\nAnd by each side a Warder walked,\nFor fear the man might die.\n\nOr else he sat with those who watched\nHis anguish night and day;\nWho watched him when he rose to weep,\nAnd when he crouched to pray;\nWho watched him lest himself should rob\nTheir scaffold of its prey.\n\nThe Governor was strong upon\nThe Regulations Act:\nThe Doctor said that Death was but\nA scientific fact:\nAnd twice a day the Chaplain called,\nAnd left a little tract.\n\nAnd twice a day he smoked his pipe,\nAnd drank his quart of beer:\nHis soul was resolute, and held\nNo hiding-place for fear;\nHe often said that he was glad\nThe hangman's hands were near.\n\nBut why he said so strange a thing\nNo Warder dared to ask:\nFor he to whom a watcher's doom\nIs given as his task,\nMust set a lock upon his lips,\nAnd make his face a mask.\n\nOr else he might be moved, and try\nTo comfort or console:\nAnd what should Human Pity do\nPent up in Murderers' Hole?\nWhat word of grace in such a place\nCould help a brother's soul?\n\n\nWith slouch and swing around the ring\nWe trod the Fools' Parade!\nWe did not care: we knew we were\nThe Devil's Own Brigade:\nAnd shaven head and feet of lead\nMake a merry masquerade.\n\nWe tore the tarry rope to shreds\nWith blunt and bleeding nails;\nWe rubbed the doors, and scrubbed the floors,\nAnd cleaned the shining rails:\nAnd, rank by rank, we soaped the plank,\nAnd clattered with the pails.\n\nWe sewed the sacks, we broke the stones,\nWe turned the dusty drill:\nWe banged the tins, and bawled the hymns,\nAnd sweated on the mill:\nBut in the heart of every man\nTerror was lying still.\n\nSo still it lay that every day\nCrawled like a weed-clogged wave:\nAnd we forgot the bitter lot\nThat waits for fool and knave,\nTill once, as we tramped in from work,\nWe passed an open grave.\n\nWith yawning mouth the yellow hole\nGaped for a living thing;\nThe very mud cried out for blood\nTo the thirsty asphalte ring:\nAnd we knew that ere one dawn grew fair\nSome prisoner had to swing.\n\nRight in we went, with soul intent\nOn Death and Dread and Doom:\nThe hangman, with his little bag,\nWent shuffling through the gloom:\nAnd each man trembled as he crept\nInto his numbered tomb.\n\n\nThat night the empty corridors\nWere full of forms of Fear,\nAnd up and down the iron town\nStole feet we could not hear,\nAnd through the bars that hide the stars\nWhite faces seemed to peer.\n\nHe lay as one who lies and dreams\nIn a pleasant meadow-land,\nThe watchers watched him as he slept,\nAnd could not understand\nHow one could sleep so sweet a sleep\nWith a hangman close at hand.\n\nBut there is no sleep when men must weep\nWho never yet have wept:\nSo we - the fool, the fraud, the knave -\nThat endless vigil kept,\nAnd through each brain on hands of pain\nAnother's terror crept.\n\nAlas! it is a fearful thing\nTo feel another's guilt!\nFor, right within, the sword of Sin\nPierced to its poisoned hilt,\nAnd as molten lead were the tears we shed\nFor the blood we had not spilt.\n\nThe Warders with their shoes of felt\nCrept by each padlocked door,\nAnd peeped and saw, with eyes of awe,\nGrey figures on the floor,\nAnd wondered why men knelt to pray\nWho never prayed before.\n\nAll through the night we knelt and prayed,\nMad mourners of a corse!\nThe troubled plumes of midnight were\nThe plumes upon a hearse:\nAnd bitter wine upon a sponge\nWas the savour of Remorse.\n\n\nThe grey cock crew, the red cock crew,\nBut never came the day:\nAnd crooked shapes of Terror crouched,\nIn the corners where we lay:\nAnd each evil sprite that walks by night\nBefore us seemed to play.\n\nThey glided past, they glided fast,\nLike travellers through a mist:\nThey mocked the moon in a rigadoon\nOf delicate turn and twist,\nAnd with formal pace and loathsome grace\nThe phantoms kept their tryst.\n\nWith mop and mow, we saw them go,\nSlim shadows hand in hand:\nAbout, about, in ghostly rout\nThey trod a saraband:\nAnd the damned grotesques made arabesques,\nLike the wind upon the sand!\n\nWith the pirouettes of marionettes,\nThey tripped on pointed tread:\nBut with flutes of Fear they filled the ear,\nAs their grisly masque they led,\nAnd loud they sang, and long they sang,\nFor they sang to wake the dead.\n\n'Oho!' they cried, 'The world is wide,\nBut fettered limbs go lame!\nAnd once, or twice, to throw the dice\nIs a gentlemanly game,\nBut he does not win who plays with Sin\nIn the secret House of Shame.'\n\nNo things of air these antics were,\nThat frolicked with such glee:\nTo men whose lives were held in gyves,\nAnd whose feet might not go free,\nAh! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\nMost terrible to see.\n\nAround, around, they waltzed and wound;\nSome wheeled in smirking pairs;\nWith the mincing step of a demirep\nSome sidled up the stairs:\nAnd with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\nEach helped us at our prayers.\n\nThe morning wind began to moan,\nBut still the night went on:\nThrough its giant loom the web of gloom\nCrept till each thread was spun:\nAnd, as we prayed, we grew afraid\nOf the Justice of the Sun.\n\nThe moaning wind went wandering round\nThe weeping prison-wall:\nTill like a wheel of turning steel\nWe felt the minutes crawl:\nO moaning wind! what had we done\nTo have such a seneschal?\n\nAt last I saw the shadowed bars,\nLike a lattice wrought in lead,\nMove right across the whitewashed wall\nThat faced my three-plank bed,\nAnd I knew that somewhere in the world\nGod's dreadful dawn was red.\n\nAt six o'clock we cleaned our cells,\nAt seven all was still,\nBut the sough and swing of a mighty wing\nThe prison seemed to fill,\nFor the Lord of Death with icy breath\nHad entered in to kill.\n\nHe did not pass in purple pomp,\nNor ride a moon-white steed.\nThree yards of cord and a sliding board\nAre all the gallows' need:\nSo with rope of shame the Herald came\nTo do the secret deed.\n\nWe were as men who through a fen\nOf filthy darkness grope:\nWe did not dare to breathe a prayer,\nOr to give our anguish scope:\nSomething was dead in each of us,\nAnd what was dead was Hope.\n\nFor Man's grim Justice goes its way,\nAnd will not swerve aside:\nIt slays the weak, it slays the strong,\nIt has a deadly stride:\nWith iron heel it slays the strong,\nThe monstrous parricide!\n\nWe waited for the stroke of eight:\nEach tongue was thick with thirst:\nFor the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\nThat makes a man accursed,\nAnd Fate will use a running noose\nFor the best man and the worst.\n\nWe had no other thing to do,\nSave to wait for the sign to come:\nSo, like things of stone in a valley lone,\nQuiet we sat and dumb:\nBut each man's heart beat thick and quick,\nLike a madman on a drum!\n\nWith sudden shock the prison-clock\nSmote on the shivering air,\nAnd from all the gaol rose up a wail\nOf impotent despair,\nLike the sound that frightened marshes hear\nFrom some leper in his lair.\n\nAnd as one sees most fearful things\nIn the crystal of a dream,\nWe saw the greasy hempen rope\nHooked to the blackened beam,\nAnd heard the prayer the hangman's snare\nStrangled into a scream.\n\nAnd all the woe that moved him so\nThat he gave that bitter cry,\nAnd the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\nNone knew so well as I:\nFor he who lives more lives than one\nMore deaths than one must die.\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThere is no chapel on the day\nOn which they hang a man:\nThe Chaplain's heart is far too sick,\nOr his face is far too wan,\nOr there is that written in his eyes\nWhich none should look upon.\n\nSo they kept us close till nigh on noon,\nAnd then they rang the bell,\nAnd the Warders with their jingling keys\nOpened each listening cell,\nAnd down the iron stair we tramped,\nEach from his separate Hell.\n\nOut into God's sweet air we went,\nBut not in wonted way,\nFor this man's face was white with fear,\nAnd that man's face was grey,\nAnd I never saw sad men who looked\nSo wistfully at the day.\n\nI never saw sad men who looked\nWith such a wistful eye\nUpon that little tent of blue\nWe prisoners called the sky,\nAnd at every careless cloud that passed\nIn happy freedom by.\n\nBut there were those amongst us all\nWho walked with downcast head,\nAnd knew that, had each got his due,\nThey should have died instead:\nHe had but killed a thing that lived,\nWhilst they had killed the dead.\n\nFor he who sins a second time\nWakes a dead soul to pain,\nAnd draws it from its spotted shroud,\nAnd makes it bleed again,\nAnd makes it bleed great gouts of blood,\nAnd makes it bleed in vain!\n\n\nLike ape or clown, in monstrous garb\nWith crooked arrows starred,\nSilently we went round and round\nThe slippery asphalte yard;\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd no man spoke a word.\n\nSilently we went round and round,\nAnd through each hollow mind\nThe Memory of dreadful things\nRushed like a dreadful wind,\nAnd Horror stalked before each man,\nAnd Terror crept behind.\n\n\nThe Warders strutted up and down,\nAnd kept their herd of brutes,\nTheir uniforms were spick and span,\nAnd they wore their Sunday suits,\nBut we knew the work they had been at,\nBy the quicklime on their boots.\n\nFor where a grave had opened wide,\nThere was no grave at all:\nOnly a stretch of mud and sand\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nAnd a little heap of burning lime,\nThat the man should have his pall.\n\nFor he has a pall, this wretched man,\nSuch as few men can claim:\nDeep down below a prison-yard,\nNaked for greater shame,\nHe lies, with fetters on each foot,\nWrapt in a sheet of flame!\n\nAnd all the while the burning lime\nEats flesh and bone away,\nIt eats the brittle bone by night,\nAnd the soft flesh by day,\nIt eats the flesh and bone by turns,\nBut it eats the heart alway.\n\n\nFor three long years they will not sow\nOr root or seedling there:\nFor three long years the unblessed spot\nWill sterile be and bare,\nAnd look upon the wondering sky\nWith unreproachful stare.\n\nThey think a murderer's heart would taint\nEach simple seed they sow.\nIt is not true! God's kindly earth\nIs kindlier than men know,\nAnd the red rose would but blow more red,\nThe white rose whiter blow.\n\nOut of his mouth a red, red rose!\nOut of his heart a white!\nFor who can say by what strange way,\nChrist brings His will to light,\nSince the barren staff the pilgrim bore\nBloomed in the great Pope's sight?\n\nBut neither milk-white rose nor red\nMay bloom in prison-air;\nThe shard, the pebble, and the flint,\nAre what they give us there:\nFor flowers have been known to heal\nA common man's despair.\n\nSo never will wine-red rose or white,\nPetal by petal, fall\nOn that stretch of mud and sand that lies\nBy the hideous prison-wall,\nTo tell the men who tramp the yard\nThat God's Son died for all.\n\n\nYet though the hideous prison-wall\nStill hems him round and round,\nAnd a spirit may not walk by night\nThat is with fetters bound,\nAnd a spirit may but weep that lies\nIn such unholy ground,\n\nHe is at peace - this wretched man -\nAt peace, or will be soon:\nThere is no thing to make him mad,\nNor does Terror walk at noon,\nFor the lampless Earth in which he lies\nHas neither Sun nor Moon.\n\nThey hanged him as a beast is hanged:\nThey did not even toll\nA requiem that might have brought\nRest to his startled soul,\nBut hurriedly they took him out,\nAnd hid him in a hole.\n\nThey stripped him of his canvas clothes,\nAnd gave him to the flies:\nThey mocked the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes:\nAnd with laughter loud they heaped the shroud\nIn which their convict lies.\n\nThe Chaplain would not kneel to pray\nBy his dishonoured grave:\nNor mark it with that blessed Cross\nThat Christ for sinners gave,\nBecause the man was one of those\nWhom Christ came down to save.\n\nYet all is well; he has but passed\nTo Life's appointed bourne:\nAnd alien tears will fill for him\nPity's long-broken urn,\nFor his mourners will be outcast men,\nAnd outcasts always mourn\n\n\nV\n\n\nI know not whether Laws be right,\nOr whether Laws be wrong;\nAll that we know who lie in gaol\nIs that the wall is strong;\nAnd that each day is like a year,\nA year whose days are long.\n\nBut this I know, that every Law\nThat men have made for Man,\nSince first Man took his brother's life,\nAnd the sad world began,\nBut straws the wheat and saves the chaff\nWith a most evil fan.\n\nThis too I know - and wise it were\nIf each could know the same -\nThat every prison that men build\nIs built with bricks of shame,\nAnd bound with bars lest Christ should see\nHow men their brothers maim.\n\nWith bars they blur the gracious moon,\nAnd blind the goodly sun:\nAnd they do well to hide their Hell,\nFor in it things are done\nThat Son of God nor son of Man\nEver should look upon!\n\n\nThe vilest deeds like poison weeds,\nBloom well in prison-air;\nIt is only what is good in Man\nThat wastes and withers there:\nPale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,\nAnd the Warder is Despair.\n\nFor they starve the little frightened child\nTill it weeps both night and day:\nAnd they scourge the weak, and flog the fool,\nAnd gibe the old and grey,\nAnd some grow mad, and all grow bad,\nAnd none a word may say.\n\nEach narrow cell in which we dwell\nIs a foul and dark latrine,\nAnd the fetid breath of living Death\nChokes up each grated screen,\nAnd all, but Lust, is turned to dust\nIn Humanity's machine.\n\nThe brackish water that we drink\nCreeps with a loathsome slime,\nAnd the bitter bread they weigh in scales\nIs full of chalk and lime,\nAnd Sleep will not lie down, but walks\nWild-eyed, and cries to Time.\n\n\nBut though lean Hunger and green Thirst\nLike asp with adder fight,\nWe have little care of prison fare,\nFor what chills and kills outright\nIs that every stone one lifts by day\nBecomes one's heart by night.\n\nWith midnight always in one's heart,\nAnd twilight in one's cell,\nWe turn the crank, or tear the rope,\nEach in his separate Hell,\nAnd the silence is more awful far\nThan the sound of a brazen bell.\n\nAnd never a human voice comes near\nTo speak a gentle word:\nAnd the eye that watches through the door\nIs pitiless and hard:\nAnd by all forgot, we rot and rot,\nWith soul and body marred.\n\nAnd thus we rust Life's iron chain\nDegraded and alone:\nAnd some men curse, and some men weep,\nAnd some men make no moan:\nBut God's eternal Laws are kind\nAnd break the heart of stone.\n\n\nAnd every human heart that breaks,\nIn prison-cell or yard,\nIs as that broken box that gave\nIts treasure to the Lord,\nAnd filled the unclean leper's house\nWith the scent of costliest nard.\n\nAh! happy they whose hearts can break\nAnd peace of pardon win!\nHow else may man make straight his plan\nAnd cleanse his soul from Sin?\nHow else but through a broken heart\nMay Lord Christ enter in?\n\n\nAnd he of the swollen purple throat,\nAnd the stark and staring eyes,\nWaits for the holy hands that took\nThe Thief to Paradise;\nAnd a broken and a contrite heart\nThe Lord will not despise.\n\nThe man in red who reads the Law\nGave him three weeks of life,\nThree little weeks in which to heal\nHis soul of his soul's strife,\nAnd cleanse from every blot of blood\nThe hand that held the knife.\n\nAnd with tears of blood he cleansed the hand,\nThe hand that held the steel:\nFor only blood can wipe out blood,\nAnd only tears can heal:\nAnd the crimson stain that was of Cain\nBecame Christ's snow-white seal.\n\n\nVI\n\n\nIn Reading gaol by Reading town\nThere is a pit of shame,\nAnd in it lies a wretched man\nEaten by teeth of flame,\nIn a burning winding-sheet he lies,\nAnd his grave has got no name.\n\nAnd there, till Christ call forth the dead,\nIn silence let him lie:\nNo need to waste the foolish tear,\nOr heave the windy sigh:\nThe man had killed the thing he loved,\nAnd so he had to die.\n\nAnd all men kill the thing they love,\nBy all let this be heard,\nSome do it with a bitter look,\nSome with a flattering word,\nThe coward does it with a kiss,\nThe brave man with a sword!"},{"title":"Easter Day","author":"Oscar Wilde","text":"The silver trumpets rang across the Dome:\nThe people knelt upon the ground with awe:\nAnd borne

Wilde","text":"I.\n\nHe was a Grecian lad, who coming home\nWith pulpy figs and wine from Sicily\nStood at his galley's prow, and let the foam\nBlow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,\nAnd holding wave and wind in boy's despite\nPeered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night.\n\nTill with the dawn he saw a burnished spear\nLike a thin thread of gold against the sky,\nAnd hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,\nAnd bade the pilot head her lustily\nAgainst the nor'west gale, and all day long\nHeld on his way, and marked the rowers' time with measured song.\n\nAnd when the faint Corinthian hills were red\nDropped anchor in a little sandy bay,\nAnd with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,\nAnd brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,\nAnd washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold\nBrought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,\n\nAnd a rich robe stained with the fishers' juice\nWhich of some swarthy trader he had bought\nUpon the sunny quay at Syracuse,\nAnd was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,\nAnd by the questioning merchants made his way\nUp through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day\n\nHad spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,\nClomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet\nCrept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd\nOf busy priests, and from some dark retreat\nWatched the young swains his frolic playmates bring\nThe firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling\n\nThe crackling salt upon the flame, or hang\nHis studded crook against the temple wall\nTo Her who keeps away the ravenous fang\nOf the base wolf from homestead and from stall;\nAnd then the clear-voiced maidens 'gan to sing,\nAnd to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,\n\nA beechen cup brimming with milky foam,\nA fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery\nOf hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb\nDripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee\nHad ceased from building, a black skin of oil\nMeet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked\nspoil\n\nStolen from Artemis that jealous maid\nTo please Athena, and the dappled hide\nOf a tall stag who in some mountain glade\nHad met the shaft; and then the herald cried,\nAnd from the pillared precinct one by one\nWent the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had\ndone.\n\nAnd the old priest put out the waning fires\nSave that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed\nFor ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres\nCame fainter on the wind, as down the road\nIn joyous dance these country folk did pass,\nAnd with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.\n\nLong time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,\nAnd heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,\nAnd the rose-petals falling from the wreath\nAs the night breezes wandered through the shrine,\nAnd seemed to be in some entranced swoon\nTill through the open roof above the full and brimming moon\n\nFlooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,\nWhen from his nook up leapt the venturous lad,\nAnd flinging wide the cedar-carven door\nBeheld an awful image saffron-clad\nAnd armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared\nFrom the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared\n\nLike a red rod of flame, stony and steeled\nThe Gorgon's head its leaden eyeballs rolled,\nAnd writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,\nAnd gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold\nIn passion impotent, while with blind gaze\nThe blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.\n\nThe lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp\nFar out at sea off Sunium, or cast\nThe net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp\nOf horses smite the waves, and a wild blast\nDivide the folded curtains of the night,\nAnd knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.\n\nAnd guilty lovers in their venery\nForgat a little while their stolen sweets,\nDeeming they heard dread Dian's bitter cry;\nAnd the grim watchmen on their lofty seats\nRan to their shields in haste precipitate,\nOr strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.\n\nFor round the temple rolled the clang of arms,\nAnd the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,\nAnd the air quaked with dissonant alarums\nTill huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,\nAnd on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,\nAnd the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.\n\nReady for death with parted lips he stood,\nAnd well content at such a price to see\nThat calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,\nThe marvel of that pitiless chastity,\nAh! well content indeed, for never wight\nSince Troy's young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.\n\nReady for death he stood, but lo! the air\nGrew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,\nAnd off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,\nAnd from his limbs he throw the cloak away;\nFor whom would not such love make desperate?\nAnd nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate\n\nUndid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,\nAnd bared the breasts of polished ivory,\nTill from the waist the peplos falling down\nLeft visible the secret mystery\nWhich to no lover will Athena show,\nThe grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of\nsnow.\n\nThose who have never known a lover's sin\nLet them not read my ditty, it will be\nTo their dull ears so musicless and thin\nThat they will have no joy of it, but ye\nTo whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,\nYe who have learned who Eros is, - O listen yet awhile.\n\nA little space he let his greedy eyes\nRest on the burnished image, till mere sight\nHalf swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,\nAnd then his lips in hungering delight\nFed on her lips, and round the towered neck\nHe flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion's will to check.\n\nNever I ween did lover hold such tryst,\nFor all night long he murmured honeyed word,\nAnd saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed\nHer pale and argent body undisturbed,\nAnd paddled with the polished throat, and pressed\nHis hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.\n\nIt was as if Numidian javelins\nPierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,\nAnd his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins\nIn exquisite pulsation, and the pain\nWas such sweet anguish that he never drew\nHis lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.\n\nThey who have never seen the daylight peer\nInto a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,\nAnd with dull eyes and wearied from some dear\nAnd worshipped body risen, they for certain\nWill never know of what I try to sing,\nHow long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.\n\nThe moon was girdled with a crystal rim,\nThe sign which shipmen say is ominous\nOf wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,\nAnd the low lightening east was tremulous\nWith the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,\nEre from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.\n\nDown the steep rock with hurried feet and fast\nClomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,\nAnd heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,\nAnd leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran\nLike a young fawn unto an olive wood\nWhich in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;\n\nAnd sought a little stream, which well he knew,\nFor oftentimes with boyish careless shout\nThe green and crested grebe he would pursue,\nOr snare in woven net the silver trout,\nAnd down amid the startled reeds he lay\nPanting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.\n\nOn the green bank he lay, and let one hand\nDip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,\nAnd soon the breath of morning came and fanned\nHis hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly\nThe tangled curls from off his forehead, while\nHe on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.\n\nAnd soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak\nWith his long crook undid the wattled cotes,\nAnd from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke\nCurled through the air across the ripening oats,\nAnd on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed\nAs through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.\n\nAnd when the light-foot mower went afield\nAcross the meadows laced with threaded dew,\nAnd the sheep bleated on the misty weald,\nAnd from its nest the waking corncrake flew,\nSome woodmen saw him lying by the stream\nAnd marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,\n\nNor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,\n'It is young Hylas, that false runaway\nWho with a Naiad now would make his bed\nForgetting Herakles,' but others, 'Nay,\nIt is Narcissus, his own paramour,\nThose are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.'\n\nAnd when they nearer came a third one cried,\n'It is young Dionysos who has hid\nHis spear and fawnskin by the river side\nWeary of hunting with the Bassarid,\nAnd wise indeed were we away to fly:\nThey live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.'\n\nSo turned they back, and feared to look behind,\nAnd told the timid swain how they had seen\nAmid the reeds some woodland god reclined,\nAnd no man dared to cross the open green,\nAnd on that day no olive-tree was slain,\nNor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,\n\nSave when the neat-herd's lad, his empty pail\nWell slung upon his back, with leap and bound\nRaced on the other side, and stopped to hail,\nHoping that he some comrade new had found,\nAnd gat no answer, and then half afraid\nPassed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade\n\nA little girl ran laughing from the farm,\nNot thinking of love's secret mysteries,\nAnd when she saw the white and gleaming arm\nAnd all his manlihood, with longing eyes\nWhose passion mocked her sweet virginity\nWatched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily.\n\nFar off he heard the city's hum and noise,\nAnd now and then the shriller laughter where\nThe passionate purity of brown-limbed boys\nWrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,\nAnd now and then a little tinkling bell\nAs the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.\n\nThrough the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,\nThe grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,\nIn sleek and oily coat the water-rat\nBreasting the little ripples manfully\nMade for the wild-duck's nest, from bough to bough\nHopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the\nslough.\n\nOn the faint wind floated the silky seeds\nAs the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,\nThe ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds\nAnd flecked with silver whorls the forest's glass,\nWhich scarce had caught again its imagery\nEre from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.\n\nBut little care had he for any thing\nThough up and down the beech the squirrel played,\nAnd from the copse the linnet 'gan to sing\nTo its brown mate its sweetest serenade;\nAh! little care indeed, for he had seen\nThe breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.\n\nBut when the herdsman called his straggling goats\nWith whistling pipe across the rocky road,\nAnd the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes\nBoomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode\nOf coming storm, and the belated crane\nPassed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain\n\nFell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,\nAnd from the gloomy forest went his way\nPast sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,\nAnd came at last unto a little quay,\nAnd called his mates aboard, and took his seat\nOn the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping\nsheet,\n\nAnd steered across the bay, and when nine suns\nPassed down the long and laddered way of gold,\nAnd nine pale moons had breathed their orisons\nTo the chaste stars their confessors, or told\nTheir dearest secret to the downy moth\nThat will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth\n\nCame a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes\nAnd lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked\nAs though the lading of three argosies\nWere in the hold, and flapped its wings and shrieked,\nAnd darkness straightway stole across the deep,\nSheathed was Orion's sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,\n\nAnd the moon hid behind a tawny mask\nOf drifting cloud, and from the ocean's marge\nRose the red plume, the huge and horned casque,\nThe seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!\nAnd clad in bright and burnished panoply\nAthena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!\n\nTo the dull sailors' sight her loosened looks\nSeemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet\nOnly the spume that floats on hidden rocks,\nAnd, marking how the rising waters beat\nAgainst the rolling ship, the pilot cried\nTo the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side\n\nBut he, the overbold adulterer,\nA dear profaner of great mysteries,\nAn ardent amorous idolater,\nWhen he beheld those grand relentless eyes\nLaughed loud for joy, and crying out 'I come'\nLeapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.\n\nThen fell from the high heaven one bright star,\nOne dancer left the circling galaxy,\nAnd back to Athens on her clattering car\nIn all the pride of venged divinity\nPale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,\nAnd a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.\n\nAnd the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew\nWith mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,\nAnd the old pilot bade the trembling crew\nHoist the big sail, and told how he had seen\nClose to the stern a dim and giant form,\nAnd like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.\n\nAnd no man dared to speak of Charmides\nDeeming that he some evil thing had wrought,\nAnd when they reached the strait Symplegades\nThey beached their galley on the shore, and sought\nThe toll-gate of the city hastily,\nAnd in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nBut some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare\nThe boy's drowned body back to Grecian land,\nAnd mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair\nAnd smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand;\nSome brought sweet spices from far Araby,\nAnd others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.\n\nAnd when he neared his old Athenian home,\nA mighty billow rose up suddenly\nUpon whose oily back the clotted foam\nLay diapered in some strange fantasy,\nAnd clasping him unto its glassy breast\nSwept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!\n\nNow where Colonos leans unto the sea\nThere lies a long and level stretch of lawn;\nThe rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee\nFor it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun\nIs not afraid, for never through the day\nComes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.\n\nBut often from the thorny labyrinth\nAnd tangled branches of the circling wood\nThe stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth\nHurling the polished disk, and draws his hood\nOver his guilty gaze, and creeps away,\nNor dares to wind his horn, or - else at the first break of day\n\nThe Dryads come and throw the leathern ball\nAlong the reedy shore, and circumvent\nSome goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal\nFor fear of bold Poseidon's ravishment,\nAnd loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,\nLest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.\n\nOn this side and on that a rocky cave,\nHung with the yellow-belled laburnum, stands\nSmooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave\nLeaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,\nAs though it feared to be too soon forgot\nBy the green rush, its playfellow, - and yet, it is a spot\n\nSo small, that the inconstant butterfly\nCould steal the hoarded money from each flower\nEre it was noon, and still not satisfy\nIts over-greedy love, - within an hour\nA sailor boy, were he but rude enow\nTo land and pluck a garland for his galley's painted prow,\n\nWould almost leave the little meadow bare,\nFor it knows nothing of great pageantry,\nOnly a few narcissi here and there\nStand separate in sweet austerity,\nDotting the unmown grass with silver stars,\nAnd here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars.\n\nHither the billow brought him, and was glad\nOf such dear servitude, and where the land\nWas virgin of all waters laid the lad\nUpon the golden margent of the strand,\nAnd like a lingering lover oft returned\nTo kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,\n\nEre the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,\nThat self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,\nEre grisly death with chill and nipping frost\nHad withered up those lilies white and red\nWhich, while the boy would through the forest range,\nAnswered each other in a sweet antiphonal counter-change.\n\nAnd when at dawn the wood-nymphs, hand-in-hand,\nThreaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied\nThe boy's pale body stretched upon the sand,\nAnd feared Poseidon's treachery, and cried,\nAnd like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade\nEach startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.\n\nSave one white girl, who deemed it would not be\nSo dread a thing to feel a sea-god's arms\nCrushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,\nAnd longed to listen to those subtle charms\nInsidious lovers weave when they would win\nSome fenced fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin\n\nTo yield her treasure unto one so fair,\nAnd lay beside him, thirsty with love's drouth,\nCalled him soft names, played with his tangled hair,\nAnd with hot lips made havoc of his mouth\nAfraid he might not wake, and then afraid\nLest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,\n\nReturned to fresh assault, and all day long\nSat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,\nAnd held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,\nThen frowned to see how froward was the boy\nWho would not with her maidenhood entwine,\nNor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine;\n\nNor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,\nBut said, 'He will awake, I know him well,\nHe will awake at evening when the sun\nHangs his red shield on Corinth's citadel;\nThis sleep is but a cruel treachery\nTo make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea\n\nDeeper than ever falls the fisher's line\nAlready a huge Triton blows his horn,\nAnd weaves a garland from the crystalline\nAnd drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn\nThe emerald pillars of our bridal bed,\nFor sphered in foaming silver, and with coral crowned head,\n\nWe two will sit upon a throne of pearl,\nAnd a blue wave will be our canopy,\nAnd at our feet the water-snakes will curl\nIn all their amethystine panoply\nOf diamonded mail, and we will mark\nThe mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,\n\nVermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold\nLike flakes of crimson light, and the great deep\nHis glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,\nAnd we will see the painted dolphins sleep\nCradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks\nWhere Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous\nflocks.\n\nAnd tremulous opal-hued anemones\nWill wave their purple fringes where we tread\nUpon the mirrored floor, and argosies\nOf fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread\nThe drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,\nAnd honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.'\n\nBut when that baffled Lord of War the Sun\nWith gaudy pennon flying passed away\nInto his brazen House, and one by one\nThe little yellow stars began to stray\nAcross the field of heaven, ah! then indeed\nShe feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,\n\nAnd cried, 'Awake, already the pale moon\nWashes the trees with silver, and the wave\nCreeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,\nThe croaking frogs are out, and from the cave\nThe nightjar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,\nAnd the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky\ngrass.\n\nNay, though thou art a god, be not so coy,\nFor in yon stream there is a little reed\nThat often whispers how a lovely boy\nLay with her once upon a grassy mead,\nWho when his cruel pleasure he had done\nSpread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.\n\nBe not so coy, the laurel trembles still\nWith great Apollo's kisses, and the fir\nWhose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill\nHath many a tale of that bold ravisher\nWhom men call Boreas, and I have seen\nThe mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar's silvery sheen.\n\nEven the jealous Naiads call me fair,\nAnd every morn a young and ruddy swain\nWoos me with apples and with locks of hair,\nAnd seeks to soothe my virginal disdain\nBy all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;\nBut yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove\n\nWith little crimson feet, which with its store\nOf seven spotted eggs the cruel lad\nHad stolen from the lofty sycamore\nAt daybreak, when her amorous comrade had\nFlown off in search of berried juniper\nWhich most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager\n\nOf the blue grapes, hath not persistency\nSo constant as this simple shepherd-boy\nFor my poor lips, his joyous purity\nAnd laughing sunny eyes might well decoy\nA Dryad from her oath to Artemis;\nFor very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss;\n\nHis argent forehead, like a rising moon\nOver the dusky hills of meeting brows,\nIs crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon\nLeads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse\nFor Cytheraea, the first silky down\nFringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and\nbrown;\n\nAnd he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds\nOf bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,\nAnd many an earthen bowl of yellow curds\nIs in his homestead for the thievish fly\nTo swim and drown in, the pink clover mead\nKeeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed.\n\nAnd yet I love him not; it was for thee\nI kept my love; I knew that thou would'st come\nTo rid me of this pallid chastity,\nThou fairest flower of the flowerless foam\nOf all the wide AEgean, brightest star\nOf ocean's azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!\n\nI knew that thou would'st come, for when at first\nThe dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of spring\nSwelled in my green and tender bark or burst\nTo myriad multitudinous blossoming\nWhich mocked the midnight with its mimic moons\nThat did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes' rapturous\ntunes\n\nStartled the squirrel from its granary,\nAnd cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,\nThrough my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy\nCrept like new wine, and every mossy vein\nThrobbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,\nAnd the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem's maidenhood.\n\nThe trooping fawns at evening came and laid\nTheir cool black noses on my lowest boughs,\nAnd on my topmost branch the blackbird made\nA little nest of grasses for his spouse,\nAnd now and then a twittering wren would light\nOn a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight.\n\nI was the Attic shepherd's trysting place,\nBeneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,\nAnd round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase\nThe timorous girl, till tired out with play\nShe felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,\nAnd turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful\nsnare.\n\nThen come away unto my ambuscade\nWhere clustering woodbine weaves a canopy\nFor amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade\nOf Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify\nThe dearest rites of love; there in the cool\nAnd green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool,\n\nThe ouzel's haunt, the wild bee's pasturage,\nFor round its rim great creamy lilies float\nThrough their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,\nEach cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat\nSteered by a dragon-fly, - be not afraid\nTo leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place was made\n\nFor lovers such as we; the Cyprian Queen,\nOne arm around her boyish paramour,\nStrays often there at eve, and I have seen\nThe moon strip off her misty vestiture\nFor young Endymion's eyes; be not afraid,\nThe panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.\n\nNay if thou will'st, back to the beating brine,\nBack to the boisterous billow let us go,\nAnd walk all day beneath the hyaline\nHuge vault of Neptune's watery portico,\nAnd watch the purple monsters of the deep\nSport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.\n\nFor if my mistress find me lying here\nShe will not ruth or gentle pity show,\nBut lay her boar-spear down, and with austere\nRelentless fingers string the cornel bow,\nAnd draw the feathered notch against her breast,\nAnd loose the arched cord; aye, even now upon the quest\n\nI hear her hurrying feet, - awake, awake,\nThou laggard in love's battle! once at least\nLet me drink deep of passion's wine, and slake\nMy parched being with the nectarous feast\nWhich even gods affect! O come, Love, come,\nStill we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.'\n\nScarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees\nShook, and the leaves divided, and the air\nGrew conscious of a god, and the grey seas\nCrawled backward, and a long and dismal blare\nBlew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,\nAnd like a flame a barbed reed flew whizzing down the glade.\n\nAnd where the little flowers of her breast\nJust brake into their milky blossoming,\nThis murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,\nPierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,\nAnd ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,\nAnd dug a long red road, and cleft with winged death her heart.\n\nSobbing her life out with a bitter cry\nOn the boy's body fell the Dryad maid,\nSobbing for incomplete virginity,\nAnd raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,\nAnd all the pain of things unsatisfied,\nAnd the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing\nside.\n\nAh! pitiful it was to hear her moan,\nAnd very pitiful to see her die\nEre she had yielded up her sweets, or known\nThe joy of passion, that dread mystery\nWhich not to know is not to live at all,\nAnd yet to know is to be held in death's most deadly thrall.\n\nBut as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,\nWho with Adonis all night long had lain\nWithin some shepherd's hut in Arcady,\nOn team of silver doves and gilded wain\nWas journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar\nFrom mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,\n\nAnd when low down she spied the hapless pair,\nAnd heard the Oread's faint despairing cry,\nWhose cadence seemed to play upon the air\nAs though it were a viol, hastily\nShe bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,\nAnd dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous\ndoom.\n\nFor as a gardener turning back his head\nTo catch the last notes of the linnet, mows\nWith careless scythe too near some flower bed,\nAnd cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,\nAnd with the flower's loosened loneliness\nStrews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness\n\nDriving his little flock along the mead\nTreads down two daffodils, which side by aide\nHave lured the lady-bird with yellow brede\nAnd made the gaudy moth forget its pride,\nTreads down their brimming golden chalices\nUnder light feet which were not made for such rude ravages;\n\nOr as a schoolboy tired of his book\nFlings himself down upon the reedy grass\nAnd plucks two water-lilies from the brook,\nAnd for a time forgets the hour glass,\nThen wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,\nAnd lets the hot sun kill them, even go these lovers lay.\n\nAnd Venus cried, 'It is dread Artemis\nWhose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,\nOr else that mightier maid whose care it is\nTo guard her strong and stainless majesty\nUpon the hill Athenian, - alas!\nThat they who loved so well unloved into Death's house should\npass.'\n\nSo with soft hands she laid the boy and girl\nIn the great golden waggon tenderly\n(Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl\nJust threaded with a blue vein's tapestry\nHad not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast\nSwayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest)\n\nAnd then each pigeon spread its milky van,\nThe bright car soared into the dawning sky,\nAnd like a cloud the aerial caravan\nPassed over the AEgean silently,\nTill the faint air was troubled with the song\nFrom the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.\n\nBut when the doves had reached their wonted goal\nWhere the wide stair of orbed marble dips\nIts snows into the sea, her fluttering soul\nJust shook the trembling petals of her lips\nAnd passed into the void, and Venus knew\nThat one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,\n\nAnd bade her servants carve a cedar chest\nWith all the wonder of this history,\nWithin whose scented womb their limbs should rest\nWhere olive-trees make tender the blue sky\nOn the low hills of Paphos, and the Faun\nPipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.\n\nNor failed they to obey her hest, and ere\nThe morning bee had stung the daffodil\nWith tiny fretful spear, or from its lair\nThe waking stag had leapt across the rill\nAnd roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept\nAthwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.\n\nAnd when day brake, within that silver shrine\nFed by the flames of cressets tremulous,\nQueen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine\nThat she whose beauty made Death amorous\nShould beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,\nAnd let Desire pass across dread Charon's icy ford.\n\n\nIII\n\n\nIn melancholy moonless Acheron,\nFarm for the goodly earth and joyous day\nWhere no spring ever buds, nor ripening sun\nWeighs down the apple trees, nor flowery May\nChequers with chestnut blooms the grassy floor,\nWhere thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,\n\nThere by a dim and dark Lethaean well\nYoung Charmides was lying; wearily\nHe plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,\nAnd with its little rifled treasury\nStrewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,\nAnd watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a dream,\n\nWhen as he gazed into the watery glass\nAnd through his brown hair's curly tangles scanned\nHis own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass\nAcross the mirror, and a little hand\nStole into his, and warm lips timidly\nBrushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a\nsigh.\n\nThen turned he round his weary eyes and saw,\nAnd ever nigher still their faces came,\nAnd nigher ever did their young mouths draw\nUntil they seemed one perfect rose of flame,\nAnd longing arms around her neck he cast,\nAnd felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,\n\nAnd all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,\nAnd all her maidenhood was his to slay,\nAnd limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss\nTheir passion waxed and waned, - O why essay\nTo pipe again of love, too venturous reed!\nEnough, enough that Eros laughed upon that flowerless mead.\n\nToo venturous poesy, O why essay\nTo pipe again of passion! fold thy wings\nO'er daring Icarus and bid thy lay\nSleep hidden in the lyre's silent strings\nTill thou hast found the old Castalian rill,\nOr from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho's golden quid!\n\nEnough, enough that he whose life had been\nA fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,\nCould in the loveless land of Hades glean\nOne scorching harvest from those fields of flame\nWhere passion walks with naked unshod feet\nAnd is not wounded, - ah! enough that once their lips could meet\n\nIn that wild throb when all existences\nSeemed narrowed to one single ecstasy\nWhich dies through its own sweetness and the stress\nOf too much pleasure, ere Persephone\nHad bade them serve her by the ebon throne\nOf the pale God who in the fields of Enna loosed her zone."},{"title":"Nay, Lord, not thus! white lilies in the spring,","author":"Oscar Wilde","text":"Seven stars in the still water,\nAnd seven in the sky;\nSeven sins on the King's daughter,\nDeep in her soul to lie.\n\nRed roses are at her feet,\n(Roses are red in her red-gold hair)\nAnd O where her bosom and girdle meet\nRed roses are hidden there.\n\nFair is the knight who lieth slain\nAmid the rush and reed,\nSee the lean fishes that are fain\nUpon dead men to feed.\n\nSweet is the page that lieth there,\n(Cloth of gold is goodly prey,)\nSee the black ravens in the air,\nBlack, O black as the night are they.\n\nWhat do they there so stark and dead?\n(There is blood upon her hand)\nWhy are the lilies flecked with red?\n(There is blood on the river sand.)\n\nThere are two that ride from the south and east,\nAnd two from the north and west,\nFor the black raven a goodly feast,\nFor the King's daughter rest.\n\nThere is one man who loves her true,\n(Red, O red, is the stain of gore!)\nHe hath duggen a grave by the darksome yew,\n(One grave will do for four.)\n\nNo moon in the still heaven,\nIn the black water none,\nThe sins on her soul are seven,\nThe sin upon his is one."},{"title":"ENDYMION (For music)","author":"Oscar Wilde","text":"The apple trees are hung with gold,\nAnd birds are loud in Arcady,\nThe sheep lie bleating in the fold,\nThe wild goat runs across the wold,\nBut yesterday his love he told,\nI know he will come back to me.\nO rising moon!
